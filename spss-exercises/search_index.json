What techniques would you use to investigate the relationship between SES and whether or not a student would participate in a racially insensitive joke? ANSWER: SES is an ordinal variable with 4 levels that should be treated as a categorical variable. Whether or not a student would participate in a derogatory joke is measured with the “Joke” variable and it is a categorical variable. The appropriate statistical procedure to use to compare two categorical variables is the Chi-Square Test of Independence (crosstabs). The appropriate graphical procedure is a clustered bar chart. Investigate this relationship graphically and statistically. What did you find? ANSWER: There is not a statistically significant relationship between “SES” and “Joke”. We do not have enough evidence to say that there is a relationship between a student’s socio-economic status and whether or not the student would participate in a racially insensitive joke. Research Question 2: Is there a relationship between a student’s race and their post intervention behavior intention scale? What techniques would you use to investigate a student’s race and their post intervention behavior intention scale? ANSWER: “Race” is a categorical variable that can take on up to 9 values and a student’s post intervention behavior intention scale (“BIndBehint_post”) is a continuous variable. The appropriate statistical procedure is a one-way ANOVA. The appropriate graphical procedure is a side-by-side box plot. Investigate this relationship graphically and statistically. What did you find? ANSWER: There is not a statistically significant relationship between “Race” and “BIndBehint_Post”. We do not have enough evidence to say that there is a relationship between a student’s race and their post intervention behavior intention score. Research Question 3: Is there a relationship between the race of a student and their socio-economic status? What techniques would you use to investigate the relationship between race and SES? ANSWER: “Race” and “SES” are both categorical predictors. The appropriate statistical procedure to use to compare two categorical variables is the Chi-Square Test of Independence (crosstabs). The appropriate graphical procedure is a clustered bar chart. Investigate this relationship graphically and statistically. What did you find? ANSWER: There is a statistically significant relationship between “Race” and “SES”. There is a significant relationship between a student’s SES and race. Notice the error message under the Chi-Square results table—in this case, we need to verify our statistically significant results with Fisher’s Exact Test (pvalue=.025). "],

["exercise-a4-case-study-i-salary-regression.html", "15 Exercise A4 – Case Study I: Salary (Regression)", " 15 Exercise A4 – Case Study I: Salary (Regression) Open ExerciseA4_Data.sav Background This data set contains information on faculty from Bowling Green State University for the 1993 to 1994 (DeMaris 2004). The purpose of the exercises below is to investigate whether there was any evidence of gender inequality in faculty salaries at BGSU. Activity 1: Describing the Dataset Investigate the ‘Faculty’ data set using descriptive statistics, one variable graphing procedures, and bivariate procedures. Investigate ‘Salary’ with descriptive statistics, box plot, and histogram Investigate ‘Gender’ with a frequency table and bar chart Investigate the average salary for males and females separately (descriptive statistics, histogram, side-by-side box plot) Remember to split the file by the gender variable (‘male’). The descriptive statistics table above indicates that males earn more than females on average. Also remember to remove the ‘Split File’ option. The Boxplot below indicates that males have a higher median salary than females, and both males and females have outliers (observation 148 and 58 respectively). Perform an independent samples t-test Remember that the dialogue box for the independent samples t-test is located under ‘Analyze’ then ‘Compare Means’. The table above indicates that we cannot assume equal variances between males and females (Levene’s Test pvalue&lt;.05). Regardless, we see that the differences between average male and female salaries are large enough to be considered statistically significant (t=10.250, df=297.227, pvalue&lt;.001). The confidence interval for the mean difference between genders is [8550.79, 12614.47]. This is the plausible range of values for the difference between males and females. Activity 2: Simple Linear Regression The independent samples t-test is one way to model the relationship between the faculty salary (dependent variable of interest) and gender (independent variable). Faculty salary may also be a function of the marketability of the discipline the faculty member is in. Investigate the correlation between ‘salary’ and ‘market’ and investigate a scatter plot of the two variables In SPSS, select Analyze - Correlate - Bivariate We see from the table above that there is a statistically significant correlation between faculty salary and marketability of the discipline (r=.407, pvalue&lt;.001). Perform a simple linear regression where ‘salary’ is the dependent/outcome variable and ‘market’ is the independent/predictor variable This can be done multiple ways in SPSS. The first way uses the regression menu from ‘Analyze’ while the second uses the ‘General Linear Model’ menu. Select Analyze - Regression - Linear Notice that the regression menu provides the correlation between the variables included in the model. The table below provides the R Square value and adjusted R Square value. The proportion of variance in faculty salary explained by marketability of discipline is 16.6%. The table below indicates that the model fitted is significantly better than what we would expect by chance (F=101.771, pvalue&lt;.001). The null hypothesis is that there is no linear relationship between faculty salary and marketability, and we reject this hypothesis. The table above provides the parameter estimates for our model. For every one unit increase in marketability, faculty salary increases by an average of $34,545. We could also interpret the beta coefficient for marketability the following way: the effect of a .1 point increase in marketability is associated with an estimated increase in mean salary of $3,454. The constant (intercept) for the model is interpreted as the estimated mean salary when marketability is equal to zero. Remember that the confidence intervals give us a range of reasonable values for an estimate. The 95% confidence interval for our estimate of market discipline is [$27817, $41272]. The hypothesis tests provided with the ‘t’ statistic and ‘Sig.’ columns help us decide if a particular value (usually zero) is a reasonable estimate. If our estimated beta coefficient for market discipline was zero, then market discipline would not have an effect/relationship with faculty salary. This is our null hypothesis, and we would like to reject this hypothesis. Here we find a significant relationship between market discipline and faculty salary (t=10.088, pvalue&lt;.001). The second method for generating results for a simple linear regression is described below. Keep in mind that this method for performing a linear regression is preferred when there are categorical predictor/independent variables or interaction terms between independent variables. Select Analyze - General Linear Model - Univariate The table below provides the descriptive statistics for faculty salary. The table above indicates that the overall regression model is significant (F=101.771, pvalue&lt;.001). This is indicated by the line for ‘Corrected Model’. The R Squared value is also listed in footnote a. for the table. The parameter estimates table above provides the same information as the previous coefficients table. Notice that the results are the same between the two methods that can be used in SPSS to perform a regression. For the remainder of the workshop we will use the second method to obtain our regression results (Analyze - General Linear Model - Univariate). Activity 3: Simple Linear Regression Diagnostics Perform the necessary regression diagnostics for the regression from exercise 2. Check the linearity and homogeneity of variance assumptions Plot the residuals against the predicted values from the model. The residuals should be randomly scattered around zero, and the variability should be constant in the plot. The scatter plot below does not indicate that either assumption has been violated. Check for influential points The scatter plot from exercise 2 did not indicate that there were points of interest. A leverage point is an unusual point that has the potential to influence the fit of the model. Sort the data set by Leverage in descending order. A rule of thumb is a point is considered to have large leverage when the leverage value is greater than 2p/n where p equals the number of parameters in the model. Here we estimate the intercept and slope for market, so p=2. This means that high leverage values are greater than 2*2/514=4/514=.0078. There are 53 points with high leverage. An influential point is one whose removal from the dataset would cause a large change in the fit of the regression model. An influential point may or may not be an outlier. Also, and influential point may or may not have large leverage. Usually an influential point will be an outlier and or may have large leverage. Sort the data set by the Cook’s distance variable in descending order. This will list the observations with the largest Cook’s distance first. Remember a distance greater than 1 or 4/n=4/514=.0078 is considered large. The first 16 observations have large Cook’s distances, but we do not have cause to remove them from the data set. Check the normality assumption for the residuals The plot below indicates that the normality assumption is reasonable. A QQ plot can also be investigated (Analyze - Descriptive Statistics - QQ Plot) Activity 4: Multiple Regression with a Categorical Predictor Faculty salary appears to be a function of the marketability of the discipline the faculty member is in, but it also may be a function of gender. Create a multiple regression model where salary is the dependent variable, and both marketability and gender are the predictors. Select Analyze - General Linear Model - Univariate Select ‘salary’ as the dependent variable, male as the fixed factor, and market as the covariate. Remember that any categorical predictor in a basic regression model should be entered in as a ‘fixed factor’, while any continuous prediction is considered a ‘covariate’. Under ‘Options’, select ‘Descriptive Statistics’, ‘Parameter Estimates’, ‘Residual Plot’ The table below indicates the number of Males and Females in the data set, along with the code that denotes the genders. The table above indicates that the average salary for males is greater than the average salary for females ($53,499.24 compared to $42,916.60). The table above indicates that the model fitted is significantly better than what we would expect by chance (F=85.799, pvalue&lt;.001). The null hypothesis is that there is no linear relationship between faculty salary and the model predictors, and we reject this hypothesis. This is indicated by the line for ‘Corrected Model’. The R Squared value is also listed in footnote a. for the table. The proportion of variance in faculty salary explained jointly by marketability of discipline and gender is 25.1%. Notice that this is an increase from the previous model. The table above provides the parameter estimates for the regression model. The difference in population mean salaries between men and women, when controlling for marketability is estimated to be $8,708.42. Remember that Dummy variables are always interpreted in relationship to the reference category. The reference category is denoted with a coefficient value of 0 and footnote a. Here, we interpret male=0 (Female) compared to male=1 (Males). Another interpretation of the gender variable: When controlling for marketability, faculty salaries are on average $8,708.42 less for females when compared to males. The marketability coefficient now is interpreted as the effect of marketability after accounting gender. For every one unit increase in marketability, faculty salary increases by an average of $29,972.60 holding gender constant. We could also interpret the beta coefficient for marketability the following way: the effect of a .1 point increase in marketability is associated with an estimated increase in mean salary of $2,997 holding gender constant. Notice that all of the predictor variables in the model are highly significant. Note that the model fit above is also sometimes referred to as an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. The inclusion of a continuous predictor (marketability) in addition to the factor gender makes this an ANCOVA model. Create a multiple regression model where salary is the dependent variable, and marketability, time since degree (yearsdg), and gender are the predictors. Investigate the coefficients and R-squared. First investigate a scatter plot between salary and time since degree. Select Analyze - General Linear Model - Univariate Select ‘salary’ as the dependent variable, male as the fixed factor, and market and yearsdg as the covariates. Remember that any categorical predictor in a basic regression model should be entered in as a ‘fixed factor’, while any continuous prediction is considered a ‘covariate’. Under ‘Options’, select ‘Descriptive Statistics’, ‘Parameter Estimates’, ‘Residual Plot’ The table below indicates that the R-squared value has increased from the last model to .684, and the model is significant (F=367.562, pvalue&lt;.001). The estimated population mean salary for women is $2,040.21 less than men for a given marketability and time since degree. The estimated effect of time since degree is $949 more in mean salary per year (*a one unit increase is a year!) since degree when comparing faculty members of the same gender from disciplines with the same marketability. For a given time since degree and gender, a one unit increase in marketability is estimated to increase average salary by $38,402. Notice that all of the predictor variables in the model are highly significant. Activity 5: Multiple Regression with an Interaction Faculty salary appears to be a function of the marketability of the discipline, time since last degree, and gender. Starting salaries could be similar for men and women, but men might receive larger increases over time. An interaction between gender and time since last degree may capture this relationship. Remember, a significant interaction implies that the effect of each variable depends on the value of the other variable—that is to say the effect of time since degree depends on gender and the effect of gender depends on time since degree. Create a multiple regression model where salary is the dependent variable, marketability, gender, time since degree, and the interaction between gender and time since degree are the predictors. Create a scatter plot: Select Graphs - Legacy Dialogs - Scatter/Dot and choose ‘Simple’ and ‘Define’. Let the y-axis be ‘salary’, the x-axis be ‘yearsdg’, and set markers by ‘male’. Select the graph in chart editor and click the box for ‘Add fit line at subgroups’. The lines for males and females are not parallel, and this is what we are investigating with the proposed interaction term. Select Analyze - General Linear Model - Univariate Select ‘salary’ as the dependent variable, ‘male’ as the fixed factor, and ‘market’ and ‘yearsdg’ as the covariates. Remember that any categorical predictor in a basic regression model should be entered in as a ‘fixed factor’, while any continuous prediction is considered a ‘covariate’. Under ‘Model’, select ‘Custom’. Under ‘Build Terms’ select ‘Main Effect’ and enter the variables male, market, yearsdg. Under ‘Build Terms’ select ‘Interaction’ and select both male and yearsdg to create the interaction term. Select ‘Continue’. Remember that main effects must always be included in a model that contains interaction terms. Under ‘Options’, select ‘Descriptive Statistics’, ‘Parameter Estimates’, ‘Residual Plot’ The table below indicates that the model is significant (F=279.95, pvalue&lt;.001) and the R-squared has increased from the last model to .688. In the presence of interaction terms, the main effect terms have different interpretations. The estimated gender gap when time since degree is zero is not significant. When time since degree is 0 years, the population mean salary for women after adjusting for the other covariates in the model is estimated to be $593 more than men. Notice the confidence intervals range from negative values (women earn less at time since degree=0) to positive values (women earn more at time since degree=0). The interaction between gender and years since degree (the change in gender gap with years since degree) is significant. For every additional year since degree completion, we see the gender gap between males and females grows by $227.153 on average when adjusting for the other covariates in the model. Activity 6: Multiple Regression with Diagnostics This exercise builds on the previous model. Add faculty rank (a three level categorical predictor) to the model and run the regression with diagnostics. Create a multiple regression model where salary is the dependent variable, marketability, gender, time since degree, faculty rank, and the interaction between gender and time since degree are the predictors. Create a side-by-side box plot for salary by rank. Select Analyze - General Linear Model - Univariate Select ‘salary’ as the dependent variable, ‘male’ and ‘rank’ as the fixed factors, and ‘market’ and ‘yearsdg’ as the covariates. Remember that any categorical predictor in a basic regression model should be entered in as a ‘fixed factor’, while any continuous prediction is considered a ‘covariate’. Under ‘Model’, select ‘Custom’. Under ‘Build Terms’ select ‘Main Effect’ and enter the variables male, market, yearsdg, rank. Under ‘Build Terms’ select ‘Interaction’ and select both male and yearsdg to create the interaction term. Select ‘Continue’. Remember that main effects must always be included in a model that contains interaction terms. Under ‘Save’ select ‘Unstandardized Predicted Values’ and ‘Standardized Residuals’. Under ‘Options’, select ‘Descriptive Statistics’, ‘Parameter Estimates’, ‘Residual Plot’ The table below displays the coding scheme used for the categorical predictors (factors). The table below provides the descriptive statistics for salary broken out by gender and rank. The table below indicates the model is significant (F=242.32, pvalue&lt;.001) and the R-squared value is .741 (an increase from the last model). We can see from the table below that faculty rank is a significant predictor of salary. The table above indicates that rank=1=Assistant Professor, rank=2=Associate Professor, rank=3=Full Professor. The estimated difference in population mean salary between Assistant Professors and Full Professors is $11,168 after adjusting for the other covariates in the model. Put another way: Assistant professors earn on average $11,168 less than Full Professors, all else equal. The estimated difference in population mean salary between Associate Professors and Full professors is $7,819 after adjusting for the other covariates in the model. Put another way: Associate professors earn on average $7,819 less than Full Professors, all else equal. The residual plot below is given from the output. First investigate the predicted (x axis) vs. std. residual plot to check for the constant variance assumption. There is not strong evidence that the assumption of constant variance has been violated. Linearity can also be assessed with this plot. Next investigate the plot of observed (x axis) and predicted values (y axis) to check the linearity assumption. The points should be symmetrically distributed on a diagonal (45 degree) line if the linearity assumption is not violated (this is approximately what we see here). Note that these plots could be made manually by creating scatter plots from the saved variables (predicted, residuals). The GLM approach to regression doesn’t allow for VIF’s to be calculated directly. Multicollinearity can attempt to be assessed through investigating the correlations or calculating the VIF manually. Note that pair wise correlations do not fully capture multicollinearity. Select ‘Analyze’ ‘Descriptive Statistics’ ‘QQ Plot’ and select the residual variable. The plot below indicates that the distribution of the error terms is approximately normal. This can also be confirmed with a histogram. "],
["exercise-a5-case-study-ii-aids-logistic-regression.html", "16 Exercise A5 – Case Study II: AIDS (Logistic Regression)", " 16 Exercise A5 – Case Study II: AIDS (Logistic Regression) Open ExerciseA5_Data.sav Background The data set for this exercise contains information on 109 countries with a number of characteristics measured for each country. The goal of the exercise is to identify whether there may be characteristics of a country that are related to AIDS rate classification. Countries are divided into one of two AIDS rate groupings: 0 = Less than 1 in 100,000 or 1 = More than 1 in 100,000. The variable in the data which holds this information is called aidscat2. We will fit several models with AIDS rate category as our outcome to identify potential significant predictors of AIDS rate classification. Because the model outcome is no longer a continuous measure, but instead binary, a logistic regression model will be used. The outcome for this type of model isn’t actually the values of the variable (0 or 1) but instead a calculation of the probability of having the value of one of the two categories of the outcome. The model has the form: \\[\\ln\\left( \\frac{p}{1 - p} \\right) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\beta_{2}x_{x} + \\ldots + \\beta_{p}x_{p}\\ \\] where p is the probability of the outcome variable being equal to 1. The \\[\\ln\\left( \\frac{p}{1 - p} \\right)\\] outcome is known as the log-odds. Note: It is possible to change which level of the outcome variable the probability references, so you can model the probability that y=0 instead of y=1 if desired. In all models for this exercise we will consider predicting the probability that a given country will have the higher AIDS rate classification (aidscat2=1). The objective of the models is to see whether the included predictors are significantly associated with the probability of having the higher AIDS rate classification. Activity 1: Logistic Regression with a Continuous Predictor For the first example, we will look at a simple example of fitting logistic regression with a continuous predictor. We will consider a single continuous predictor (log base 10 of the gross domestic product per capita, LOG_GDP). Perform a simple logistic regression where ‘aidscat2’ is the outcome variable and ‘log_gdp’ is the independent/predictor variable. Select Analyze - Regression - Binary Logistic’ to open the logistic regression dialogue box. Select AIDSCAT2 as the binary dependent variable. Note that the category whose probability we want to model, “high” AIDS rate, is coded as a 1, and the other category, “low” AIDS rate, is coded as 0. SPSS automatically fits the highest valued category probability. If the opposite is desired the outcome variable should be recoded so the opposite category has a higher value. Select LOG_GDP as the only covariate, and click OK to fit the model. Results from fitting this model are included below. The first table rovides some information regarding the cases (rows) used to fit that data. Note that three cases were lost in the analysis, due to missing data on the AIDSCAT2 variable. The final analysis sample size was 106. The coding of the dependent variable is critical to understand. SPSS will model the probability that the “internal value” of the dependent variable is equal to 1. The “internal value” is the value that SPSS recodes the outcome to be to fit the model behind the scenes. This will not always match up to your original coding so check this table carefully. In our case the 0/1 internal coding that SPSS performs matches up with our original 0=less than 1 in 100,000 and 1=more than 1 in 100,000 coding so we will be modeling the probability of being in the “high” AIDS rate. This initial classification table, located in “Block 0” of the output, shows how well we would do predicting by chance what the outcome will be (i.e., not using any covariates to predict the outcome). Because more countries have the higher classification, we would predict that classification for all of the countries, and we would be correct 64.2% of the time. This table isn’t all that informative by itself, we will compare it to a similar table in the next portion of the output. This table, also in the “Block 0” portion of the output, shows the maximum likelihood estimate of the intercept term in a logistic regression model without any covariates. This is simply the computed log-odds of the dependent variable being equal to 1. We’ll scroll down to the “Block 1” portion of the output, which will contain the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters in our model. These estimates describe the relationship of LOG_GDP to the dependent variable (aidscat2). First, we examine the classification table for our outcome given that we are now considering the LOG_GDP variable as a predictor. This table is similar to predicted values in linear regression. For each country in the data set the predicted probability is computed using the fitted model and values of the country’s covariate. If the predicted probability is greater than 0.5 the country is classified into the ‘high’ AIDS rate group and if it is less than 0.5 it is classified into the ‘low’ AIDS rate group. These classifications are then compared with the actual observed classifications of the countries. Note that we are actually doing a worse job of predicting the AIDS rate when using LOG_GDP as a predictor (63.2% correct vs. 64.2% correct when we don’t consider any covariates). The predicted probabilities can be saved in the SPSS data set as an option if desired. Now, we examine the maximum likelihood estimate of the coefficient for LOG_GDP in the logistic regression model: The estimate of the parameter that represents the coefficient for LOG_GDP in the model is equal to 0.491, with a standard error of 0.329. The Wald statistic reported by SPSS is the squared version of the T statistic (the coefficient divided by its standard error, squared), and is referred to a chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom. This Wald statistic has a p-value of 0.135, which suggests that we would not reject a null hypothesis that the coefficient for LOG_GDP is equal to 0. We really don’t have evidence of a significant relationship of LOG_GDP with the AIDS rate outcome. However, if the relationship were significant, we would conclude that a one-unit increase in LOG_GDP results in an expected increase of 0.491 in the log-odds of being in the higher AIDS rate category. The parameter estimates represent additive changes to the log-odds. If exponentiated we get the more common odds ratio, which is the multiplicative change to the odds. Here the Exp(B) column holds the exponentiated esimates, for log_gdp the odds ratio is equal to 1.634. This value has the meaning that the odds of being in the higher AIDS rate category are multiplied by 1.63 with every one-unit increase in LOG_GDP. Activity 2: Logistic Regression with a Categorical Predictor Now, we’ll consider an example of analyzing a single categorical predictor with two levels, whether or not the country is predominantly muslim (MUSLIM). MUSLIM is coded as 1 = yes and 0 = no, which we would recommend for any two-level predictors. Select ‘Analyze’-&gt;‘Regression’-&gt;‘Binary Logistic’ to re-enter the logistic regression dialogue box. Replace the log_gdp covariate with muslim. We need to identify the predictor as categorical so select the categorical button. Move the MUSLIM covariate into the ‘Categorical Covariates’ list. Fit the logistic regression model by clicking on OK. Let’s jump down to Block 1 in the output and first examine the classification table based on the model including the MUSLIM variable: Note the substantial improvement in prediction accuracy by considering Muslim status! Now, we investigate the maximum likelihood estimate of the coefficient for MUSLIM: The maximum likelihood estimate of the coefficient is -2.335, with a standard error of 0.537. The Wald statistic based on that estimate is 18.934, and the p-value for that Wald statistic is said to be 0.000 by SPSS (but should be reported as p &lt; 0.001). This p-value suggests that we should reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to 0, which tells us that Muslim status has a significant relationship with the probability of being in the higher AIDS rate category. Specifically, when MUSLIM is equal to 1 (as opposed to 0), the log-odds of being in the higher category are expected to decrease by -2.335. This estimate corresponds to an odds ratio of 0.097 (the exponential version of the coefficient), which says that the odds of having a higher AIDS classification for a Muslim country is 0.097 times the odds of having a higher AIDS classification for a non-Muslim country. The expected odds are multiplied by 0.097 when a country is Muslim as opposed to non-Muslim. We can also interpret this as reducing the odds of being in the higher AIDS rate category by 90.03% for muslim countries. Notice here, when we see a decrease in the odds (odds ratio less than 1) we report 1-Odds Ratio as the percentage (1-.097=.9003). Activity 3: Logistic Regression with Multiple Predictors In this analysis, we hope to find ways to categorize countries into one of two AIDS prevalence categories, based on other data for the countries. We will also discover which pieces of information are useful in predicting AIDS prevalence, and which appear to be unassociated with this prevalence. Set up a logistic regression model to predict AIDS prevalence category (aidscat2) by considering the following predictors: muslim, log_gdp, babymort, urban, lit_fema, lifeexpf, birth_rt, tropical. Have SPSS report confidence intervals for the odds ratios. (This is found under the ‘Options’ button in the Logistic Regression dialogue box.) Which predictors appear useful in predicting AIDS category? Do Muslim countries still have lower odds of being in the higher AIDS prevalence category when controlling for the relationships of the other predictors with the outcome? How much lower are the odds of a Muslim country being in the higher AIDS category? The first table shows us that only 83 countries are used to fit this model, 26 were removed from analysis due to missing data on any of the variables used. The first classification table (Block 0: Beginning Block) in the output shows you the result of classifying cases strictly by predicting them to be in the category with the largest percentage in the data set (in this case, you would predict a random case to be in the higher AIDS category, since 64.2% of the cases with a valid AIDS category are in the higher AIDS category). We would only be correct 59% of the time predicting by chance. The ‘Model Summary’ table shows the –2 log-likelihood statistic for our model, as well as two analogs of R2 in the multiple regression context for a logistic regression model. These are approximations of R-squared in linear regression models, and should not be reported as the same thing; they should really only be used to compare the fits of competing models fitted using the same cases. The Cox &amp; Snell R Square approximation suggests that our predictors explain about 43% of the variation in our response (not bad). The Nagelkerke R Square is a rescaled approximation that is constrained to fall between 0 and 1. The Block 1 classification table shows an increase in the percentage that is correctly classified (89.2% vs 59%) using the predicted probabilities and a ‘cut-off’ classification probability of 0.5. Let’s examine the estimated coefficients for the predictors included in our model: The B column contains the estimated coefficients in the logistic regression model, which indicate the change in the log-odds of “success” (in this case, being in the higher AIDS category) associated with a one-unit increase in each predictor. So, for example, a one-unit increase in Muslim (or being in a Muslim country) decreases the log-odds of being in the higher AIDS category by 6.553, holding all other predictors constant. The Sig. column provides the results of a significance test for each of the parameters (or coefficients) for the predictors in the model. This shows that Muslim, lit_fema, and tropical are significant predictors of being in the higher AIDS category. If a predictor is significant, changes in the predictor have a significant relationship with the log odds of “success.” The Exp(B) column indicates the factor by which the odds of “success” are multiplied when the predictor increases by one unit, holding the other predictors constant. So, for example, a one-unit increase in Muslim will multiply the odds of being in the higher AIDS category by 0.001, or reduce the odds of being in the higher AIDS category by 99.9%. The Exp(B) factor is known as an odds ratio. The 95% confidence interval for Exp(B) will not contain 1 if the predictor is significant. An odds ratio of 1 means that one-unit changes in the predictor multiply the odds of “success” by 1, or effectively do not change the odds. "],
