I am a statistical consultant at [CSCAR](http://cscar.research.umich.edu/) and adjunct faculty in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan.

I contribute to the development of several R packages:

- [*optmatch*](https://markmfredrickson.github.io/optmatch) [[Github](https://github.com/markmfredrickson/optmatch), [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/optmatch/index.html)] implementing optimal full matching.
- [*rlemon*](https://errickson.net/rlemon) [[Github](https://github.com/josherrickson/rlemon), [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rlemon)] providing an R interface to the [LEMON graph library](https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon).
- [*rrelaxiv*](https://errickson.net/rrelaxiv) [[Github](https://github.com/josherrickson/rrelaxiv)] providing an R interface to the RELAX-IV algorithm for solving the min cost flow problem.

My teaching website can be found [here](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jerrick/).

My dotfiles can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/josherrickson) page [here](https://github.com/josherrickson/dotfiles).

Below you will find various resources I've created which may be useful.

**[Workshops](workshops.html)**: Notes for workshops I have given

**[Statistical Notes](stats-notes.html)**: Short-form documents discussing various statistical topics.

**[Misc. Code & Software](code.html)**: Bits and bobs that are probably useful to almost nobody, about topics like Linux or Emacs.
