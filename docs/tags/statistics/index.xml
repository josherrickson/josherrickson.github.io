      <description>Generally you should not just subset complex survey data to do subpopulation analysis, instead using the built in tools, e.g. Stata&amp;rsquo;s svy, subpop(z): ... or R&amp;rsquo;s subset.survey.design
However, in the following two scenarios, subsetting versus formal subpopulations will give identical results:
The subpopulation are strata. For example, say you stratify by race where race can take on categories &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;black&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;other.. If you want to look at one race (&amp;ldquo;black&amp;rdquo;) (or several races [&amp;ldquo;black&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo;]), these subpopulations capture one (or several) entire strata.</description>

      <description>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(statistics)
The rule of three states that if a certain event did not occur in a sample with n subjects, the interval from 0 to 3/n is a 95% confidence interval for the rate of occurrences in the population. When n is greater than 30, this is a good approximation of results from more sensitive tests.
