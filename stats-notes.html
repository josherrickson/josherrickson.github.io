<h1 id="statistics-notes">Statistics Notes</h1>
<p><a href="marginsnotes/index.html">Marginal Effects</a>: A long-form document on using marginal effects (marginal means and marginal slopes) to improve interpretation of regression coefficients, especially in the presence of an interaction. Presents as a rosetta stone for Stata’s <code>margins</code> command and R. <em>Software</em>: Stata and R.</p>
<p><a href="stats-notes/logtransform.html">Interpreting log transformations in regression</a>: Interpreting coefficients from a linear regression model (or linear mixed model) when the predictor and/or the outcome have been log transformed. <em>Software</em>: R, though concepts could transfer to other software.</p>
<p><a href="stats-notes/mixedModelsSPSS.html">Random intercepts in SPSS’s Mixed Model</a>: There are two ways of specifying random intercepts in SPSS’s Mixed Model; this discusses their equivalence. <em>Software</em>: SPSS.</p>
<p><a href="stats-notes/moderationMediation.html">Moderation and Mediation via Regression</a>: Although moderation and mediation typically arise in SEM/path analysis frameworks, moderation can be addressed in regression, and mediation can be conceptualized through regression.</p>
<p><a href="stats-notes/iccirr.html">IRR and ICC</a>: Some notes on IRR versus ICC, as well as how to obtain the ICC. <em>Software</em>: R, though concepts could transfer to other software.</p>
<p><a href="stats-notes/visualizeCollinearity.html">The issue of collinear predictors</a>: A visualization to see the potential negative effect of including highly collinear variables in a model. <em>Software</em>: R, though concepts could transfer to other software.</p>
<p><a href="stats-notes/regressioncoefs.html">Interpreting regression coefficients of different models</a>: Very sparse notes on interpreting coefficients in linear, logistic, Poisson and negative binomial regression models.</p>
<p><a href="stats-notes/xtsetvsmixed.html">Stata, <code>xt</code> versus mixed model</a>: Econometricians usually use the <code>xt</code> framework to address repeated measures. This document shows how to fit the equivalent of fixed effects regression, between effects regression, and random effects regression using linear regression (<code>regress</code>) and linear mixed models (<code>mixed</code>). <em>Software</em>: Stata.</p>
<p><a href="stats-notes/vizrandomeffects.html">Nested versus crossed random effects</a>: Multiple random effects in a mixed model are typically defined as either “nested” or “crossed”. This document shows that this is a false dichotomy (nested random effects aren’t real!), as well as showing some nice visualization. <em>Software</em>: R, though concepts could transfer to other software.</p>
<p><a href="stats-notes/splinesvsinteraction.html">Linear splines versus interactions</a>: Models such as interrupted time series or diff-in-diff are often considered special analyses. This document attempts to show that these are just regression models with particular interactions. <em>Software</em>: Stata, though concepts could transfer to other software.</p>
<p><a href="stats-notes/randomselection.html">Selecting a random subset of the data, potentially within subgroups</a>: An easy way to generate a random sample of your data of arbitrary size, including a stratified approach. <em>Software</em>: Stata, though concepts could transfer to other software.</p>
<p><a href="stats-notes/svy_gsem_teffects.html">Mediation with Survey data</a>: To fit a mediation model in Stata using complex survey data requires using <code>gsem</code>. Unfortunately, the <code>gsem</code> command does not support directly estimating direct, indirect and total effects. This documents how to compute them. <em>Software</em>: Stata.</p>
