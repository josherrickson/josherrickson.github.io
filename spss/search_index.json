Originally, SPSS stood for Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Now, it stands for Statistical Product and Service Solutions. SPSS has also been known as “PASW” which stands for Predictive Analytics Software. 2.2 SPSS Compared to Other Statistical Software Packages We can think of statistical software packages on a spectrum organized by difficulty and complexity. On one end we have Excel which is easy and familiar to most people. On the other end we have C++ which is difficult and unfamiliar. All software packages are somewhere in between. SPSS is closer to the Excel end of the spectrum which makes is convenient to use. SPSS builds on what you already know from Excel, which makes the transition from Excel to a more powerful statistical software package easier. Easiest: Excel SPSS Minitab JMP Stata,SAS R/S-Plus Matlab Hardest: C++ SPSS requires that data, code, and output are in separate places, unlike Excel. These differences seem big at first, but they are a small price to pay for the additional data management, graphical, and statistical capabilities that SPSS will give you over Excel. While SPSS seems to be more restrictive than Excel, the restrictions it sets ensure that your data set is ready for statistical analysis. 2.3 The Three Parts of SPSS There are three parts to SPSS, each with its own window: Data Editor, Output Viewer, and Syntax Window. The sections below describe each of these parts in detail. Data Editor Enter and View Data Values, files end in .sav or.por Output Viewer View Statistical Results, files end in .spv Syntax Window Write &amp; Run Syntax Command, files end in .sps 2.3.1 Data Editor The Data Editor is visible when SPSS starts up. There are two views of the Data Editor: Data View and Variable View. In Data View, each row represents one case (e.g., one survey respondent), while each column represents one variable (one piece of information, e.g. age). By using the scroll bars to go up and down, you can examine any case in the sample. By using the scroll bars to go right and left, you can see any variable. The first step in an SPSS session is to open a data file or start entering data in a new data file. A data file is a binary file ending in the extension .sav or .por, which contains a given data set. Any requested statistics or analyses that are performed pertain to this data set. 2.3.1.1 Open a Data File To open a data file, go to “File” at the upper left of the menu bar. Click “Open” then “Data”. Locate the file that you want to open and double-click on it. Try it: Open Exercise0_Data Start a New Data File To start a new data file, go to “File” at the upper left of the menu bar. Click “New” then “Data”. 2.3.2 Output Viewer The output viewer is a window where any statistical results, including tables or graphs, can be viewed. The output window does not appear until the first time SPSS is asked to provide some sort of results. The output viewer will also record the syntax used to generate the results. Try it: Open Exercise0_Output The output viewer is divided into two parts: on the left, a narrow window shows an outline which organizes all the results. The outline can be used to delete certain portions of the output, rearrange pieces of the output, jump to specific results, and temporarily hide (or make visible) certain parts of the output. More on this later. The actual results themselves are in the larger window to the right. When printing the output, only the information in this window is printed. Once the viewer has been opened, it will remain open even if all the output is deleted and the output window is empty. Occasionally the results from a procedure will be quite lengthy, and only the first portion will appear in the window. In these cases, a small red triangle pointing down will appear at the bottom of this visible portion. To see those results in their entirety, double-click on that section of output. Scroll bars will appear which pertain to that piece of output; scroll down to see the remainder. 2.3.2.1 Labels in Output Variable labels and value labels will be used in place of the actual variable names or values, by default. This can be changed under the Edit - Options - Output tab. SPSS can display labels only, the actual names or values only, or both. 2.3.2.2 Tables &amp; Charts Results are commonly presented in the output viewer in table form or chart (graph) form. To edit a table, double-click on that table (anywhere will do). An editing window is set up around that table, indicated by a rough gray outline. New menus appear in the menu bar at the top. Once this editing mode is begun, double-clicking in any cell in a table will allow you to change the names, labels, or values in those cells. Helpful Hint: To remove scientific notation in a table, double-click on the table and highlight the columns or rows containing the notation. Under Format - Cell Properties and select a new numeric format, such as #,###.##. The number of decimal places can be increased or decreased here as well. Editing a chart is similar to editing a table. Begin by double-clicking anywhere on the chart and the Chart Editor window will appear. Once in the Chart Editor, many things can be altered simply by double-clicking and changing fields in the dialogue boxes which appear. Try it: Double click on the Descriptive Statistics table for the salary variable. Change the Std. Deviation to have only two digits to the right of the decimal point. 2.3.2.3 Export Output You can save the output file for future use or to send to colleagues. In order to open a SPSS output file, your computer must have SPSS. Sometimes it is useful to export the information from your output file into another format, such as Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word. Excel is a great platform to export to—tables turn out very nicely. To export, select File - Export and the export wizard will appear. Select the file type and the location to save the file, then select “OK”. Try it: Export the output table as an Excel file and investigate the Excel file. Starting with SPSS Version 11.5, selected output objects, such as charts and tables, can also be exported in an Excel or Word format. This is a very useful feature that can be used to export selected tables from the Output Viewer into an Excel format, for additional work such as creation of custom graphs. To export charts, select the charts in the output window by clicking once on them, and then go to File - Export and select “Selected” where it asks what objects to export. Choose the “html” file type for charts, and under the Graphics portion of the dialogue box a drop down menu allows one to access the various types of image files available. The bitmap image format is one option. Although these images are somewhat large in terms of kilobytes, they can be read by a great many programs, including Word, Power Point and others. One last option for exporting SPSS output is to copy and paste all output into a Word file. The steps are as follows: Click once to select the piece(s) of output to move. Go to Edit - Copy, press the short-cut ctrl-C, or right-click and select “Copy”). In Word, place the cursor where the output will go. Under “Edit”, click “Paste”, or use the short-cut ctrl-V. You can then resize and move around the pasted objects in Word. The same process outlined above should work for other Microsoft programs, such as Power Point or Excel. While pasted objects can be edited in theory, this is usually difficult. It is best to do all editing in SPSS before pasting to Word. 2.3.3 Syntax Window The Syntax Window looks like the Output Viewer, but it is a text editing window in which SPSS commands can be written out by hand. It allows users to type commands in the right-hand side window rather than use menus. Commands executed using written code are no different from commands executed using the pull-down menus and dialogue boxes. There are some rare instances when something is available only by writing syntax, and cannot be found in any menu. The syntax window provides these advantages: It allows a user to do repetitive tasks more quickly, using copy &amp; paste. It provides a written record of data management and analyses performed. It can be sent to other SPSS users to help in setting up data files or to re-create your analyses. Try it: Open Exercise0_Syntax. You can generate syntax in a few different ways: Write out the syntax by hand. Use the “Paste” button inside a dialogue box. Copy and paste the syntax from the output viewer. The “Paste” button in dialogue boxes causes the written syntax equivalent of a command to be entered into the syntax window. A new syntax window will open if no syntax window was open previously. 2.3.3.1 Run Syntax To run commands in the syntax window, highlight the commands of interest and go to Run - Selection. Alternatively, you can click on the toolbar button that looks like a “Play” symbol on a CD player or press ctrl-R as a short-cut. You can also run all commands in the syntax window by using Run - All. Try it: In the Syntax Window, highlight number 3 and run the selection highlighted below. Check the Output Viewer. Repetitive Commands As a simple example of repetitive commands, consider a user who needs to take logs of thirty different variables. To go through the menus and do thirty computations would be quite time-consuming. This is a case where using syntax would be easier, because cut, copy, and paste commands are available in the Syntax Window. If you pasted one such computation command to the syntax window, you could then copy the command out thirty times. You would only need to edit the variable names in each line. The steps for using syntax for repetitive commands are: Paste one example command into the syntax window. Copy this command by highlighting it and typing ctrl-C or by right clicking and copying. Paste the command repeatedly using ctrl-V or right clicking and pasting. Edit each line by changing the variable names. Run the commands! Once again, the cut, copy, and paste commands have these short-cuts: Cut ctrl-X Copy ctrl-C Paste ctrl-V Helpful Hint: If you want to start setting up a data set, by formatting variables, recoding, etc., you can begin before you receive all the data. Test your data management commands on the cases you do have, and save the syntax file. When you receive the final data delivery, you can re-run the syntax one last time and be ready to go! Try it: Highlight Number 5, copy and paste the syntax. Modify the syntax such that VARIABLES=salbegin. 2.3.3.2 Reading in Raw Data with Syntax Reading in raw data files is another common use of the syntax window. Many organizations will provide large, publicly available data sets by distributing the raw data and a SPSS syntax file which reads in and formats that data. If you receive a raw data file and a SPSS syntax file, sometimes referred to as data definition statements, then follow these steps to get a copy of the data file in SPSS format: Start SPSS, but do not open any data file yet. Open the syntax file containing the commands to read the data. At the top of the syntax, find the “FILE HANDLE” statement. Change the path and the name of the file to match the current file location and name (the file should contain instructions as well). Select Run - All . 2.3.3.3 Syntax Examples 1) Accessing an SPSS data file and rename the dataset GET FILE = 'C:\\SPSS\\data\\example.sav'. EXECUTE . DATASET NAME example. 2) Entering new variables and data DATA LIST LIST / age (F2.0) sex (A1) income (F2.1) ethnic (F1.0). BEGIN DATA 45 F 60.9 2 52 M 22.3 1 34 M 45.8 3 67 F 34.5 1 END DATA. 3) Creating new numeric or string variables NUMERIC ses (F1.0) / numkids yrsmarr (F2.0).

FILTER BY filt_var. EXECUTE . 20) Returning to the entire sample after looking at a subset FILTER OFF. EXECUTE. 21) Splitting the observations into strata, so that future analyses will be repeated for each stratum separately SORT CASES BY ethnic . SPLIT FILE BY ethnic . 2.3.3.4 Writing Syntax Tips Each command must begin on a new line and must end with a period. A comment can be included in a syntax file. The comment starts with an asterisk (*) and can go beyond one line. A period (.) is required in the end of the last line to terminate the comment. SPSS syntax is case insensitive. Capitalized words are used to indicate keywords and command names in SPSS documentation, while lowercase letters indicate user-specified words; this is only a convention. String values must be enclosed in single or double quotes. Commands, sub-commands, and keywords can be abbreviated to three letters, but use four or five to avoid ambiguities. Variable names must always be typed out in full. Numbers and underscores are valid in a variable name if they are not the first letter. The use of capitals will not distinguish two variable names; “name” and “NAME” are identical. Sub-commands are preceded by a forward slash ( / ); they need not begin on a new line. However, lines of code can’t be more than 80 characters long. The word “EXECUTE” and a period (.) should be included after each command, such as COMPUTE and RECODE, that requires changes to the data set. Adding in “EXECUTE.” will never hurt anything; if in doubt, include it. Labels and other items enclosed in quotes must not run onto the next line. The word “then” never appears in “if then” types of commands. 2.4 Good to Know 2.4.1 Dialogue Boxes The main way that a user tells SPSS what to do is through dialogue boxes. These are windows that pop up when you click on an item in a menu or double-click on particular objects. Try it: In Data View for Exercise0_Data, select Analyze - Descriptive Statistics - Descriptives. While dialogue boxes vary according to the task involved, they all have at least some of the following buttons: “OK” Carries out the procedure; executes the command now. “Continue” Returns to the main dialogue box after specifying an option. “Paste” Writes out the syntax for the procedure in a syntax window. “Reset” Returns the dialogue box to its original blank state. “Cancel” Closes the dialogue box without taking any action. “Help” Opens up a help window specific to that procedure. In most dialogue boxes, you select certain variables from the list on the left and move these variables into the active variable box on the right. Here are some tips: Click on any variable in the variable list, then type the first few letters of a variable name to zoom to that name in the list. Hold down shift and click on any two variables to select every variable in between. Hold down ctrl and click to select multiple variables that are not necessarily adjacent in the list. You could choose to display either variable labels or names in the variable list. For example, if you want the names to be displayed, go to then “Edit” menu and click “Options”. When a new window comes up, click on the tab labeled “General”. In the “Variable Lists” section, choose option “Display names” or “Display labels” for variable labels. 2.4.2 Adding Comments You can add descriptive comments to data files by going to Utilities - Data File Comments. 2.5 Tips for Preparing an Excel File for Use with SPSS Place the variable names in the first row. Be sure the names follow these rules: variable names should be no more than 64 characters long (and no longer than 8 characters is usually recommended) variable names must start with a letter variable names may only have letters, numbers, or underscores in them the following characters must not appear in variable names: %,$,#,@,!,+,*,~,\",-,. no blank spaces can appear in variable names each variable name must be unique, with no duplicate variable names variable names can be on one row only Only include the raw, un-summarized data. Delete extraneous data in your Excel file, like row or column totals, graphs, etc. Include an identifying number for each case that is unique. If you have several spreadsheets for one person, include the identifier on each sheet. Only include one value per cell. Don’t enter data such as “120/80” for blood pressure. Enter systolic blood pressure as one variable, and diastolic blood pressure as another variable. Don't leave blank rows in the data. Don’t mix numeric and character values, such as names and ID numbers, in the same column. Character variables are allowed in statistical packages but are not as flexible as numeric variables. Use numeric values when feasible. If you have missing values, you can indicate them with a numeric code, such as 99 or 999, or you can leave the cell blank. Be sure, if you use a missing value code, that it is not a plausible real data value. Save the spreadsheet with values only – not formulas. An ideal Excel data set might look like this: 2.6 Exercise 1 – Properly Formatted Data In order to analyze data properly in SPSS, we need to follow the guidelines set out in the course notes. Open Exercise1_Data and see what guidelines we have ignored. 2.7 Importing Data into SPSS SPSS can easily read in data from Excel, SAS or Stata, as well as several lesser used options. To open a file from another program, go to File - Open. Under “File Type” find the program the data file was created in. Select this type and find the file you’d like to open. Click “Open”. It’s that easy – the data file should appear. If your data is not stored in a format that SPSS can read, then first convert the file to Excel format. Excel is a useful liaison between other programs and SPSS. Try it: Select File - Open. Investigate the different file types that you can open. Data files that are in TEXT FORMAT (.txt) are either delimited or divided into columns of fixed length. SPSS provides a wizard that asks questions and makes intelligent guesses in order to import your text data. This facility is somewhat like Excel’s data-reading wizard. Delimited files have rows of values that are separated by tabs, commas, or spaces. A row of data from a tab-delimited file might look like: Name Age Gender Occupation Yearly Salary Jim 25 Male Accountant 65,000 A row of data from a comma-delimited file might look like: Name,Age,Gender,Occupation,Yearly,Salary Jim,25 ,Male,Accountant,65,000 Read delimited files into SPSS by going to File - Read Text Data. First, locate the name of the text file and click Open. Answer the questions as you go along, clicking Next to move on to the next question. Be sure to choose the Delimited file type, and identify the character (comma, space, tab, etc) that acts as the delimiter. Similarly, read fixed-column data files by going to File - Read Text Data. Open the file containing the text data. Follow along with the questions, clicking Next to move along. Be sure to select the Fixed width option. You may name the variables for either delimited or fixed width files during the import procedure, or after the data have already been read into the Data Editor. Sometimes the variable names are already in the top row of the text file. You will be able to tell SPSS whether these names are present or absent in the text file. Note that for fixed width data, particularly when many variables are involved, it may be easier to use syntax commands rather than the menus. This will provide a record of how the data were imported, and it will allow you to stop and resume the import process in a later SPSS session. When using the menus, there is no way to stop halfway through and save your work. 2.8 Exporting Data from SPSS To save files in a certain format so that you can move data from SPSS to another program (this is exporting from SPSS), make certain you are in the Data Editor window, and go to File -&gt; Save As and then select “File Type”. Be sure to give this new file a name. You can export to most of the same file types as you can import. You can also select a subset of variables to save in a new data file by selecting the “Variables…” button in the “Save Data As” window. Once you have selected the variables that you want for the new data file, select “Continue” then “Save”. Try it: Select File - Save As. Investigate the different file types. Select the “Variables” button and investigate. 2.9 Exercise 2 – Importing/Exporting Excel Open Exercise2_Data (an Excel file). Modify this Excel file such that it can be imported into SPSS properly. Save the file and close it. Open the file in SPSS (import it). Export this file back into Excel, but only save the following variables: id, salary, minority. 2.10 Getting Help from SPSS Underneath the help menu are several different options. Here are a few: “Topics” Search for a word or command “Tutorial” Get an introduction to some SPSS basics “Case Studies” Look at some example analyses using SPSS “Statistics Coach” Get help in choosing the right statistical procedure “Syntax Reference” View syntax manuals in their complete form (.pdf) “SPSS Home Page” Open an internet browser and go to www.spss.com “About” View version number and license expiration date “Product Registration” Renew the license once it has expired When looking at a help entry for a statistical procedure, there will usually be a link labeled “Show Me”, which provides explicit instructions for carrying out the procedure via an example. The “Command Syntax Reference” menu allows users to access the entire text that can be found in the hard-copy manuals. The on-line manuals open in Adobe Acrobat Reader and come with an index of topics. Click on any page number to go instantly to that page. Helpful Hint: when examining the on-line syntax guides, click the small button at the bottom marked “100%” and choose 150% or 200% for easier reading. "],

Some values, such as “don’t know” replies on a survey, may be codes for missing values. SPSS allows you to label variables and values with more meaningful phrases that can appear in the output for greater clarity. To view or edit the current format for a variable, double-click on the variable’s name in the Data Editor. Doing this will open the Variable View tab in the Data Editor window. Alternatively, select the “Variable View” tab at the bottom left corner of the data editor window. Try it: Open Section2_Data.sav. Select “Variable View”. There are eleven columns in the Variable View, containing values that are attributes for the variables that you can change: Name The name of each variable in the data set Type The type (numeric, character, date, etc) and length Width The amount of information in bytes stored in memory Decimals The number of decimals displayed for numeric vars Label A specific label for a variable Values Variable value labels Missing Missing value codes Columns Column width for variable display Align The alignment of values within a cell Measure The measurement scale for a variable Input The role of the variable when analyzing the data 3.1.1 Variable Name Be sure the names follow these rules: Variable names should be no more than 64 characters long, and preferably no more than 8 characters long. Variable names must start with a letter. Variable names may only have letters, numbers, or underscores in them. Variable names may not have the following characters: %,$,#,@,!,+,*,~,\",-,.. Variable names may not have blank spaces. Each variable name must be unique; the same variable name can’t appear twice. Variable names must be on one row only. 3.1.2 Variable Type The most fundamental characteristic of a variable is its type. These are the four most important types: Numeric includes comma, dot, and scientific notation types String also called character, alpha, or alpha-numeric Dollar includes custom currency type but is still numeric Date is still numeric but displayed using hours, minutes, and seconds Most statistical analyses use only numeric variables. SPSS can handle a short string variable, such as gender coded as “m” and “f”, when that variable defines groups for a t-test or an analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Dollar type changes the way the values appear in the data editor and the output, but all analyses treat the Dollar type as numeric. The appearance of a date variable does not affect the way that the .sav file stores the date. SPSS understands date/time variables as the number of seconds since midnight, October 14, 1582 which is a significant date marking a change in the Gregorian calendar. If you subtract one date from the other to create a new variable, the result will be in seconds. To change back to days, hours, or years, it is necessary to use a function to turn the information into a more usable, practical form. See the section Computing New Variables for more information. Try it: Use Section2_Data.sav. Change the Variable Type for the ID variable from Dollar to Numeric. 3.1.3 Variable Labels Variable labels attach a description to a variable, and this description can show up in the output. To enter a variable label, click in the Label cell for a given variable in Variable View, and enter a description for the variable. Variable labels can be up to 255 characters as of Version 15.0. Try it: Use Section2_Data.sav. Provide a label for DepScale (Depression Scale 1998). 3.1.4 Value Labels Value labels are similar, except that they refer to specific values within that variable. You don’t have to enter labels for all values. A value label can be up to 120 bytes long. Suppose the following question was in a survey: Which of the following describes your political beliefs best? 1) Democrat 2) Republican 3) Libertarian 4) Other You will enter the responses as 1, 2, 3, or 4. These numbers are arbitrarily, however, and some users may not know or may forget their meaning. Value labels allow the user to attach meaning to the numbers. Value labels are absolutely critical in large data files. Like variable labels, value labels will appear in many of the results provided by SPSS. To assign value labels, click on the Values cell for a given variable, and click on the small grey box. Enter a number in the Value box, then the corresponding label in the Value Label box. Then press “Add”. If you do not press “Add”, the information you have typed for that value will be ignored. Try it: Use Section2_Data.sav. Enter in value labels for variable Education: 1=High School or Less 2=Some College 3=College Graduate 3.1.5 Missing Value Labels There are two kinds of missing values: system-missing, in which the cell is empty, and user-missing, which flags a value as an invalid response. There often could be several reasons that a value is not available, and user-missing values allow us to discriminate between them. Examples of user-defined missing values are: 99 “Don’t Know” reply on a survey 777 Inapplicable, such as with number of births for a male respondent -999 Respondent refused to answer, which often occurs with income Enter user-missing values just like any other response during data entry. You need to tag the value as missing, however, so that SPSS does not include it in any computations. Consider the repercussions if we forgot to specify the 777 in the above example as Inapplicable, and then attempted to calculate the average number of births! You can specify user-missing values by clicking on the cell in the Missing column for a given variable, and then clicking on the small grey box that appears as “(…)”. You may specify single values or a range of values. Try it: Use Section2_Data.sav.Enter missing value codes for Education (99). 3.1.6 Columns &amp; Alignment You can change the alignment of the data by changing the Columns or Align attributes. You can use the Align attribute to center values or align them to the right or left of the cell in the Data Editor. Additionally, you can decrease or increase the width of the columns using the Columns attribute. A shortcut is to place the mouse at the right edge of a variable name, click on the border, and drag the column to be wider or narrower. Asterisks (*) in the cells within a particular column mean that the column is not wide enough to display the data values. Simply increase the column width and the values should appear properly in the Data Editor. Another possible problem might be that the width is too small to display all of the information for a variable. The Columns and Align attributes have no effect on the data; they only affect the way you see the data in the editor. 3.1.7 Measure Each variable in SPSS may be designated as Scale a continuous variable Ordinal a categorical variable with natural ordering Nominal categorical without any natural ordering Graphs from the Interactive graphics method use this information. This field has no bearing for most procedures. Try it: Use Section2_Data.sav. Change the Measure for the Education variable from Scale to Ordinal. 3.1.8 Copy and Paste Variable Attributes You can set up any of the attributes discussed above, such as type, labels, missing values, and column format, and apply them to numerous variables all at once. Suppose a researcher has a series of 50 variables that all have values 1 through 5 as follows: 1 Strongly disagree 2 Disagree 3 Neutral 4 Agree 5 Strongly agree Value labels would be useful for these variables, but it would be extremely tedious to set up value labels for all 50 variables. Set up the value labels for one of the 50 variables, and then click on the cell containing the value labels for that variable. Select “Copy” from the “Edit” menu or hit CTRL + C, and then highlight the value labels cells for the remaining 49 variables by clicking on the first empty cell and dragging downward. Select “Paste” from the “Edit” menu or hit CTRL + V, and the value labels will be applied to the remaining 49 variables instantly. You can also right-click and use the copy and paste functions. You can use this same copy and paste feature for other variable attributes and save a great deal of time! Try it: Use Section2_Data.sav. Copy and paste the missing value code from Education to DepScale. 3.1.9 Exercise 3 – Variable Attributes Open Exercise3_Data and go to Variable View. Practice defining the correct attributes to each variable by following the code book below. 3.2 Creating New Variables and Defining the Correct Attributes To create a new variable in SPSS for entering data, simply double-click on an empty column’s heading, or start entering data directly into the column in Data View. To enter values, first click in an empty cell; then type each value and press either return or the down arrow. During data entry, be aware that the order of cases in an SPSS data file can change because certain procedures require that cases be sorted. Therefore, be careful to match values with an ID variable. The case that occupied the first row in the file a week ago may not be in the first row any longer! New variables, including those created by computation or recoding, appear at the far right of the data file. Use the scroll bar at the bottom to verify that a new variable was properly created. Cut, copy, or paste a variable or insert a new empty column by right clicking on a variable name. A pasted variable is not inserted in between existing variables. It replaces the highlighted column entirely, and could over-write an existing variable. Be sure to create a new, blank column and paste on top of that. Try it: Use Section2_Data.sav. Create a new variable called NewVar. 3.3 Computing Variables You can use the COMPUTE command to create new numeric or string variables by: Assigning a particular value to all cases, or a subset of cases Transforming a variable by taking a log, or another mathematical function Creating a sum, average, or other summary of several existing variables Helpful Hint: You can use the COMPUTE procedure to edit or overwrite an existing variable, but we highly recommend that you create new variables. If you do over-write an existing variable, be aware that some old values may not be overwritten. If some of the necessary information is missing for a certain case in the file, and the software cannot compute the new value, then the value from the old variable will remain. Select Transform - Compute Variable and enter a name for the new variable in the upper left box, labeled “Target Variable.” SPSS will automatically create the new variable when it executes the compute command. By default, SPSS assumes that the user wants to compute a numeric variable. If you want to create a string variable, click “Type &amp; Label” underneath the new variable name, and select “String.” In the box titled “Numeric Expression”, provide the actual formula or value for the new variable. You may write the numeric expressions by hand or insert variables and functions using the mouse. Helpful Hint: Click on the function name to get a function description in the dialogue box. If you want to create new dollar or date variables, then proceed as if creating a numeric variable. The type can be changed after the compute command is used. Note that seconds are the units of measurement for date variables. To create date variables, we must use functions specifically designed for the date variable type. See the List of Functions below for more information. 3.3.1 Dealing with Missing Data Applying a function to a variable containing missing values will result in a variable with corresponding system-missing values. When taking the mean or sum of a set of variables, be sure to use the mean() and sum() functions. SPSS only evaluates formulas such as “(var1 + var2 + var3 + var4)/4” if all four variables have valid, non-missing values. By contrast, the software evaluates the formula “mean(var1, var2, var3, var4)” as long as an individual has at least one valid response. You can also stipulate that SPSS perform the calculation only when there are a minimum number of valid responses. The formula “mean.3(var1, var2, var3, var4, var5)”, for example, would mean that an individual must have answered at least 3 of the 5 questions. The new variable will have a missing value otherwise. Try it: Use Section2_Data.sav. Calculate the average depression score using DepScale_01, DepScale_02, DepScale_3. First use the function “mean”. Next write the expression by hand. Investigate the differences. 3.3.2 List of Functions Available in the Compute Command Arithmetic Operators: + Addition - Subtraction * Multiplication / Division ** Exponentiation Arithmetic Functions: ABS Absolute value RND Round TRUNC Truncate MOD Modulus (remainder) SQRT Square root EXP Exponential LG10 Base 10 log LN Natural log ARSIN Arcsin ARTAN Arctangent SIN Sine COS Cosine Statistical Functions: SUM(.n) Sum of arguments MEAN(.n) Mean of arguments SD(.n) Standard deviation of arguments VARIANCE(.n) Variance of arguments CFVAR(.n) Coefficient of variation of arguments MIN(.n) Minimum of arguments MAX(.n) Maximum of arguments Missing Values Functions: MISSING True if the value is missing NMISS Number of missing values across variables but within cases NVALID Number of non-missing values across variables but within cases Across-case Function: LAG Value from previous case, or from n cases earlier if there is a second argument n Date and Time Functions: CTIME.xxx SPSS time values to common units DATE.xxx Common units to SPSS date values TIME.xxx Common units to SPSS time values XDATE.xxx SPSS date values to common units Other Functions: RV.UNIFORM Uniform pseudorandom no.

This procedure counts how many times particular values occur, within each case, across certain variables. Suppose we have a data set of students where we recorded their scores on ten separate quizzes over the course of a semester. We could use “Count Values within Cases” to tally up the number of A’s each student earned. To use the Count Values within Cases procedure: Go to Transform - Count Values within Cases. Specify a new variable name under “Target Variable”. Place the variables to be examined in the “Variables” box. Click “Define Values”, and type the values to be counted. Click “Continue”, then “OK”. Recoding Variables Recoding a variable means changing or “mapping” its values to new ones. Often, you will need to convert string variables into numeric variables in order to use them in a certain statistical procedure. Recoding is also a way to collapse a continuous variable into categories. Below are representations of some possible recodes: “Male” – 1 “Female” – 0 1 – 0 2 – 1 3 – 2 4:15 – 9 3.3.4 Manual Recoding There are two ways to recode in SPSS: Recode Into Same Variables Not Recommended Recode Into Different Variables Recommended By using “Recode Into Different Variables”, your original variable will not change, which is not the case with “Recode Into Same Variables”. “Recode Into Same Variables” is risky since you will not be able to undo the changes if you make a mistake. Select Transform - Recode into Different Variables\" In the “Recode Into Different Variables” dialogue box: Select the old (original) variable. Specify a new variable name, and click “Change”. Click “Old and New Values”. Specify each old value, or range of values, on the left side of the box and each new number you want assigned on the right side of the box. Click “Add” each time. Make sure you include every original value. Unmentioned original values become missing values in the new variable. Click “Continue”. Click “OK”. Note that when using “Recode Into Different Variables”, it is also possible to recode a numeric variable into a character (string) variable, or vice-versa: Check the box marked “Output variables are strings” to change from numeric to string in the “Old and New Values” window Check the box marked “Convert numeric strings to numbers” to change from string to numeric in the “Old and New Values” window. Try it: Use Section2_Data.sav. Recode Gender with F=1 and M=2. Inspect the output. 3.4 Automatic Recoding The Automatic Recode procedure recodes any variable’s values into consecutive integers 1, 2, 3, etc…. The software codes the lowest numeric value, or the first value in alphabetical order in the case of string variables, to a 1 by default. The next lowest number or next item in alphabetical order becomes a 2, and so forth. Optionally, the recoding can begin with the highest number of the last string value in alphabetical order. Automatic Recode always creates a new variable. Helpful Hint: Automatic Recode is a quick way to make string variables (e.g., gender) ready for statistical procedures that require numeric variables. To use Automatic Recode: Go to Transform - Automatic Recode. Choose the original variable to be recoded. Specify a new variable name and click “Add New Name”. Select the order – start numbering from smallest or largest values. Helpful Hint: If you had assigned value labels for the old variable, those labels will carry over to the corresponding new values. If there were no value labels, then the old values themselves become the new labels. Try it: Use Section2_Data.sav. Use Automatic Recode to recode Gender. Call this new variable AutoGender. 3.5 Conditional Transformations with If/Then Logic The “If” button, which appears in the Compute, Recode, and Count dialogue boxes, represents an important feature in variable transformations. Using the “If” option, users can tell SPSS to perform calculations or recodes only if cases meet certain conditions. For example, suppose we surveyed women regarding the number of times they had given birth, but women who had never been pregnant skipped that section of the questionnaire. We might now want to assign a “0” for the number of births for those women who had never been pregnant, to replace the missing entry they currently have. Assuming that we have a string variable called “everpreg” coded “Y” and “N” for yes and no, and that our number of births variable is called “numbirth”, we would proceed as follows: Go to Transform - Compute Variable Put numbirth in the “Target Variable” box. Place a 0 in the “Numeric Expression” box. Click “If”. Click “Include if case satisfies condition”. Type everpreg = “N” in the condition box. Click “Continue” and “OK”. This “If” button, which allows transformations to take place for selected cases only, works exactly the same in the Compute, Recode, and Count procedures. You can use the words and, or, and not within the If box to help write your criteria. Some examples of If expressions are as follows: sex = “f” and age &gt; 50 *women over 50 not missing(income) *participants whose income is known educat = 5 or educat = 6 *respondents with a BA or MA 3.6 Rank Cases You can perform variable transformations based on the ranked value for a particular variable. It may be more convenient to analyze the quartiles, for example, than the variables themselves. Select “Transform” and then “Rank Cases” to recode a continuous variable into a new variable based on rank. Select the variable of interest and then click “Rank Types”. You can select quartiles in this dialogue box by checking the box for Ntiles and placing the number 4 in the blank space. SPSS will create a new categorical variable and add it to the end of the original dataset. 3.7 Exercise 4 – Computing and Transforming Variables Open Exercise4_Data. Compute a new variable that is the change from beginning salary to current salary for each employee. Recode the education variable into a new variable according to the following 1=High School or Less (educ&lt;=12) 2=Some College (12&lt;educ&lt;=16) 3=Bachelor’s Degree or Higher (educ&gt;=17) "],
["understanding-data-management-tasks.html", "Chapter 4 Understanding Data Management Tasks 4.1 Sorting Cases 4.2 Analyzing Subsets of Data 4.3 Analyzing Groups of Data Separately 4.4 Exercise 5 – Subsetting Data 4.5 Converting Data Formats", " Chapter 4 Understanding Data Management Tasks 4.1 Sorting Cases Sorting cases based on a particular variable is often necessary when managing data sets. Go to Data - Sort Cases to place the cases in order. Choose the variable that determines the ordering, and choose “Ascending” or “Descending”. Selecting the ID variable and choosing “Ascending” will place the subject with the smallest ID number in the top row. The bottom row will contain data on the subject with the largest (highest) ID number. When sorting by more than one variable, SPSS sorts the data initially based on the first variable. Within each value of that first variable, it sorts again based on the second variable. Make sure to select “Ascending” or “Descending” for each variable when you are sorting by multiple variables. Highlight the variable by clicking on it, and choose the correct ordering. Suppose we want to sort by gender and then by age, with both in ascending order. Suppose the codes for gender are as follows: 0 male 1 female SPSS would first put males at the top of the file and females at the bottom. SPSS would then sort by age within each gender group. The first rows of the data set would contain the youngest men in the sample and the last subjects at the bottom would be the oldest women in the sample. 4.2 Analyzing Subsets of Data You can use the “Select Cases” command to instruct the software to calculate statistical results or summaries based on only some of the cases in the data set. You can define the subset by certain characteristics, such as women over age 40, or you can instruct the software to select a random sample of cases with size that you specify. Note: The Select Cases procedure affects which cases that SPSS includes in analysis and output only. It has no effect on transformations of the data, such as computing, recoding, or counting. Selecting cases involves turning on a filter that handles the inclusion of certain cases and the exclusion of others. When the filter is on, analyses or summaries will only use the selected cases. There will be a message “Filter On” at the bottom right of the Data Editor window whenever SPSS is using only selected cases. The first time you invoke the “Select Cases” procedure, the software creates a variable called filter_$ in the data set. This variable is equal to 0 for excluded cases and 1 for included cases. SPSS deletes and then re-creates the filter_$ variable each time you run “Select Cases”. Users can specify their own filter variable. He or she can use any variable as a filter as long as a value of 0 for that variable indicates exclusion and a value of 1 inclusion. Click the “Use filter variable” option under Data - Select Cases to do this; move your filter variable into the box. 4.2.1 If Condition is Satisfied Go to Data - Select Cases\" to use only some of the cases. Click “If condition is satisfied….” to select cases based on certain criteria. Then click the “If…” button to pull up a window in which you will state the condition. Some example conditions are: gender=‘m’ *selects men only age&lt;=12 and sex=2 *selects children 12 and under of one sex only marital=0 *selects all never married respondents You can return to the data editor by clicking “Continue” and “OK”. Notice that certain rows have been “scratched” out by SPSS. SPSS has filtered out these cases because they did not satisfy the specified condition. Analyses will only use those cases that are not scratched out. To return to the entire sample, go to Data - Select Cases, choose the radio button next to “All Cases,” and then click “OK”. The “Filter On” message will disappear and all results from that point on refer to the entire data set. 4.2.2 Randomly Selecting Subsets You may examine a randomly selected portion of the data by clicking “Random Sample of Cases” in the “Select Cases” window. Then click the “Sample…” button. You can then give an approximate percentage. If you want to take an exact number of cases, first determine the total number of cases (rows) and place this number in the “from the first --- cases” segment of the dialogue box. If you would like to take a precise number of cases from, say, all women, or all children under twelve, then sort the data first so that the cases of interest occupy the first rows. Determine the last row that refers to a female, or to a child under twelve, and proceed as above. Note: When SPSS selects cases randomly, repeated selections will be different even when everything specified by the user has stayed the same. An approximate 30% sample of cases will result in a different 30% each time the user repeats the procedure. Helpful Hint: To use the same random selection of cases over and over again, first take the initial random sample. Then re-name the filter_$ variable to any name of your choosing. SPSS will leave the variable alone, and you can re-use the filter in consecutive SPSS sessions. 4.2.3 Output Options At the bottom of the “Select Cases” dialogue box are three options: Filter out unselected cases (recommended) Copy selected cases to a new dataset (recommended) Delete unselected cases (NOT RECOMMENDED) If you set this to “Filter out unselected cases”, the unselected cases remain in the data set but the software temporarily excludes them from all analyses. If you choose the second option, SPSS copies the selected cases to a new dataset and you can save the dataset on your disk by assigning a file name. The content of your original dataset remains untouched with these two options. If the you change the option to “Delete unselected cases”, unselected cases disappear from the data entirely. Be careful when permanently deleting cases, because you CANNOT undo the deletion. Make sure to first save your data file under a different name if you wish to permanently delete cases. Try it: Use Section2_Data.sav. Select only observations with Education = 1 for analysis. 4.3 Analyzing Groups of Data Separately When analyzing groups of cases separately, such as men and women, the Split File command spares you from having to repeatedly select different groups of cases. The Split File command first sorts the data into groups based on a specified variable. After that, SPSS generates any requested output for each group separately. If we split the file based on gender and then request the mean current salary, we would receive a mean current salary for men and a mean current salary for women. A flag at the bottom right of the data editor will read “Split File On” when you are using this option. You can use multiple variables to divide the data. If you use both gender and job category as grouping variables, for example, then SPSS will give all output for each job category group within each gender. To use Split File: Go to Data - Split File. Click on “Compare Groups” or “Organize Output by Groups”. Select variable(s) which divide the data into groups. Click OK. To turn off the Split File command, return to Data - Split File and click on “Analyze all cases, do not create groups”. Try it: Use Section2_Data.sav. Obtain the descriptive statistics for DepScale_01 for males and females separately. Hint: Select Analyze - Descriptive Statistics - Descriptives. 4.4 Exercise 5 – Subsetting Data Open Exercise5_Data. Select male managers. What is their average age? (You can obtain the average age by choosing Analyze - Descriptive Statistics - Descriptives and moving “Age of Respondent (age)” to the right hand side.) Use the “Split File” procedure to get the average age for each job category. 4.5 Converting Data Formats Different statistical methods frequently require different data formats. A repeated measures analysis of variance, for example, requires that data be in Wide format, while a linear mixed model requires that the data be in Long format. SPSS makes it easy to convert between the two formats. The examples below demonstrate how to use the wizard in SPSS. To convert a dataset from one format to the other, first select “Data” and then “Restructure”. SPSS uses terminology that differs from conventional phrasing. Wide to Long Variables into Cases Long to Wide Cases into Variables We will briefly discuss these two variations, before doing exercises together which include the instructions. 4.5.1 Wide to Long (AKA “Variables into Cases”) S:\\dept\\Workshops\\Workshop Slides\\SPSS Intro for ESIN\\Notebook\\MODIFY\\Slide13.JPG There are seven steps in this Wizard: Identify the restructuring plan to be from “Variables into Cases”. Select the number of variable groups. Select variables. Create index variables (usually one). Create one index variable. Choose options. Finish. 4.5.2 Long to Wide (AKA “Cases into Variables”) S:\\dept\\Workshops\\Workshop Slides\\SPSS Intro for ESIN\\Notebook\\MODIFY\\Slide27.JPG There are five steps in this Wizard: Identify the restructuring plan as “Cases into Variables”. Select variables. Sort the data. Choose options. Finish. 4.5.3 Exercise 6 – Restructuring I (Wide to Long) Convert Exercise6_Data from “Wide” format to “Long” format 4.5.4 Exercise 7 – Restructuring II (Long to Wide) Convert Exercise7_Data from “Long” format to “Wide” format (Both exercises to be done together.)

Each graphical or statistical procedure is good for a particular situation we may run into while doing data analysis. The main purpose of any graphical and statistical procedure is to investigate a variable or the relationships between variables. That is a very important concept! THE MAIN PURPOSE OF ANY GRAPHICAL OR STATISTICAL PROCEDURE IS TO INVESTIGATE A VARIABLE OR THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN VARIABLES. Keep in mind that graphical procedures can be more valuable to you than statistical procedures. You should try to express your results in graphs whenever you can. It is not hard to implement or interpret any graphical or statistical procedure once you understand and can explain the procedure. SPSS is very helpful in both regards. The biggest challenge facing any researcher is to know the most appropriate procedure to apply in any particular situation. The types of the independent and dependent variables (predictors and outcome) will guide your choice for the appropriate graphical and statistical procedure. Just like in many things in life, the 80/20 rule somewhat applies to statistics. There are a small number of procedures that you will use more repeatedly than others. Here, we will divide those essential procedures, graphical and statistical, into 4 major classifications: One Variable Only Procedures One-on-One Procedures investigating two variables at a time Many-on-One Procedures Repeated, Longitudinal, Clustered, Multilevel, and Mixed Procedures 5.2 Correlation vs. Causation The presence of a correlation between two variables DOES NOT imply that there is causation between them. Any of the three scenarios below could explain the correlation between two variables A and B. We can’t tell using statistics alone which scenario it is. A causes B B causes A C causes both A and B 5.3 Everything On One Page Handout The chart on the next page lays out the essential graphical and statistical procedures by type and classification. 5.4 Parametric vs. Non-parametric Tests There are varying assumptions that underlie the validity of each statistical procedure. A common assumption for statistical procedures is that the samples being analyzed should come from an underlying normal distribution. If this is not a reasonable assumption, you can use non-parametric tests. Non-parametric tests do not have this distributional assumption, and generally use ranks in the place of the raw scores. The table below gives non-parametric tests that are equivalent to common parametric tests. 5.5 Basic Summary Statistics (Investigate One Variable at a Time) As the name implies, One-Variable-Only Procedures help us investigate a single variable at a time. They can tell us about the frequency distribution of a categorical variable (Frequency Table, Mode, Bar Graph, Pie Chart, etc.). They can give us insight into the central tendency of a continuous variable (Mean, Median, Mode, etc.). They can help us test a hypothesis about the mean of a variable (One Sample t-test). They can give us insight into the dispersion of a variable (Standard Deviation, Range, Inter-Quartile Range, Boxplots, Error Bar Plots, etc.). They can also give us insight into the relative position of any data point with respect to the other data points in a variable (Percentiles, Quartiles, Boxplots, etc.). In SPSS, there are two procedures which provide simple descriptive statistics. You can find both procedures under Analyze - Descriptive Statistics. Frequencies procedure provides the number and % of cases which have each value of a variable (e.g., 46% male, 54% female). You can request other output by clicking Statistics. Frequencies are most useful for categorical variables. Try it: Use Section4_1_Data.sav. Obtain the frequency (descriptive) statistics for the variable Sex. Descriptives provides the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and non-missing sample size by default. Other statistics are available by clicking Options. Descriptives are most useful for continuous variables, and sometimes useful for ordinal data (categorical data with ordering, e.g., small, medium, large) alongside the frequencies. Try it: Use Section4_1_Data.sav. Obtain the descriptive statistics for the variable Age. As a first step in data analysis, one might run frequencies on all categorical variables and descriptives on all continuous variables. Obtaining descriptive statistics is an important step to detect possible data entry errors. 5.6 Visualizations There are two methods for creating charts in SPSS, Chart Builder and Legacy Dialogs. (There is a third method, in which other analysis methods create their own graphics, but we’re covering only direct creation of graphics here.) The newer approach is Chart Builder, which is a more free-form approach. It has a steeper learning curve but is ultimately more powerful. The classic approach is legacy dialogs which are much easier to use, but more restrictive in the types of plots they can create. 5.6.1 Chart Builder To create a graph in “Chart Builder”, first select the type of graph that you would like to create by dragging and dropping the appropriate graph image to the “Chart Preview” area. Once you select a chart, the Element Properties window will appear. The Element Properties window allows you to modify what is displayed in the graph Try it: Use Section4_1Data.sav. Create a simple bar chart for “Region”. 5.6.2 Legacy Dialogs The “Legacy Dialogs” interface requires that you determine the type of graph you would like to create before providing a dialog box, which is similar to other procedures in SPSS. After you select the general type of graph or chart, SPSS will then prompt you to be more specific. If the general form is a scatter plot, for example, SPSS will ask you to then specify which type of scatter plot you would like to create. The software will present you with the graphing dialogue box once you specify the specific form for the graph. Try it: Use Section4_1Data.sav. Create a simple bar chart for “Region”. 5.7 Normality Many statistical procedures assume “normality”, which means the population which the data is from follows the Normal Distribution. You may know this as the “bell curve”. https://s15-us2.ixquick.com/cgi-bin/serveimage?url=https:%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2Fd%2Fdf%2FBellcurve.svg%2F2000px-Bellcurve.svg.png&amp;sp=e6ff634ca3ce0a0de1bfab4490a45ca7 Many real-life variables follow a normal distribution such as height. If you were to collect a random sample of heights, most people would fall near the mean height for the population. Some people would be much taller or shorter, and a very limited number of people would be extremely short or extremely tall. The normality assumption as written is usually quite strict; in practice we often loosen it. Rather than “The data comes from a normal population”, you can think of it as “The data comes from a population that’s not too badly non-normal.” Essentially, you’re looking for major violations of normality, rather than trying to determine whether the bell curve perfectly fits your data. Finally, a large sample size oftens “protects” you from normality violations; the larger the sample size, the more extreme a normality violation needs to be to be a concern. While there are formal tests of normality, typically assessment is done with a histogram (looking for that bell shape) or a QQ-plot, which looks for its values to fall along the 90° line. The histogram can be created from the Histogram Legacy Dialog, the QQ-plot is created under Analyze - Descriptive Statistics - QQPlot. Try it: Use Section4_1Data.sav. Obtain a histogram for the variable “Age” and display the normal curve. Obtain a QQ plot for the variable “Age”. Hint: Analyze - Descriptive Statistics - QQPlot. 5.8 Exercise 8 – Data Exploration and Visualization Open Exercise8_Data.sav Part 1: Investigate the variable attributes. Determine which variables are categorical variables (nominal and ordinal), and which variables are continuous (scale). Obtain the appropriate descriptive statistics for each variable. Remember, continuous variables should be investigated with descriptives and categorical variables should be investigated with frequency tables. *Hint: Select more than one variable in the “Analyze”,“Descriptive Statistics”,“Descriptives”, or “Frequencies” dialog boxes. Part 2: Assess the distribution of the Occupational Prestige Score (“prestg80”) with both a histogram (normal curve displayed) and a Q-Q plot. Is the assumption that the population of Occupational Prestige Scores is normally distributed reasonable? Part 3: Compare the average highest year of school completed (“educ”) for males and females. *Hint: First split the file by “sex” (Data - Split File), then calculate the descriptive statistics. Be sure to return to the Split File menu when you are done with this question and return the dialog box to “Analyze all cases”. Part 4: Produce a pie chart for the variable “region”. (We didn’t cover this, you can use either Chart Builder or Legacy Dialogs.) 5.9 Investigating Two Variables at a Time The main purpose of any graphical and statistical procedure is to investigate a variable or the relationships between variables. We start by examining the relationship between variables using simple two-variable procedures. The type of independent and dependent variables that you would like to investigate determines the appropriate statistical or graphical procedure. Remember that the presence of a correlation between two variables DOES NOT imply that there is causation between them. 5.9.1 Pearson Correlation Coefficient &amp; Scatterplots The Pearson Correlation Coefficient measures the linear association of two continuous variables. A scatterplot is an easy way to visually explore the association between two variables. When you plot the variables together, you obtain a clear sense of the overall relationship between the two variables. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient (Pearson’s r) varies from -1 to +1. A value of zero indicates that there is no linear relationship between the two variables, a value of +1 indicates that there is a perfect positive linear relationship, and a value of -1 indicates that there is a perfect negative relationship. Positive relationships imply that variable 2 increases when variable 1 increases, and vice versa, while negative relationships imply variable 2 increases when variable 1 decreases, and vice versa. The statistical significance of a correlation is the chance that you would observe a correlation that high or higher if there really was no correlation between the variables. For the Pearson Correlation Coefficient in SPSS, select Analyze - Correlate - Bivariate. For the Scatterplot in SPSS, select Graphs - Legacy Dialogs - Scatter/Dot, choose “Simple Scatter”, and click “Define”. Try it: Use Section4_2_Data.sav. Investigate the correlation between the individual behavior intention scales. Select Analyze - Correlate - Bivariate. Select “BIndBehInt_Pre” and “BIndBehInt_Post”. Select “OK”. {width=“5in” The table indicates that there is a significant correlation between the pre intervention and post intervention behavior scale scores. Our p-value (Sig (2-tailed)) is less than our predetermined 0.05 level of significance, so we reject the null hypothesis that there is not an association between these two variables. The correlation coefficient is positive, indicating that high scores for one variable correspond to high scores for the other variable. Conversely, low scores for one variable correspond to low scores for the other variable. Individuals who scored high on the pre-test also tended to score high on the post test. To visually investigate this relationship, use a scatterplot: Select Graphs - Legacy Dialogs - Scatter/Dot. Select “Simple Scatter” and “Define”. Select “BIndBehInt_Post” for the Y Axis. Select “BIndBehInt_Pre” for the X Axis. Select “OK”. The scatterplot indicates a linear relationship between the two variables. 5.9.2 Pearson Chi-Square Crosstabs and Test of Independence The Chi-square test is very common way to explore the relationship between two categorical variables. This tests the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the two variables, and rejecting the null hypothesis allows us to conclude that the variables have a statistically significant relationship with each other. Suppose that we’re interested in determining if there is a significant relationship between smoking status and lung cancer status. Our variables are: 1) Smoking Status (1=Yes, 0=No) , and 2) Lung Cancer Status (1=Diagnosed, 2=Not Diagnosed). We can summarize these variables in a 2x2 table called a crosstab where the cell values represent the counts in our data that fall in those particular categories. We can perform a Chi-square test to determine if there is a relationship between smoking and lung cancer. Select Analyze - Descriptive Statistics - Crosstabs for the Chi-square test of independence and make sure to check the box “Chi-Square” under “Statistics”. You can produce a clustered bar chart to visualize this table by checking the box for “Display Clustered Bar Chart” in the “Crosstab” dialog box. Try it: Use Section4_2_Data.sav. Are females more likely to participate in jokes that are derogatory to any racial group? Investigate the data to see what types of variables we have to answer this question. We have the categorical variable “Sex” and the categorical variable “Joke”. Since we are comparing two categorical variables, we will use a Chi-square test. Select “Analyze” “Descriptive Statistics” “Crosstabs”. Select “Sex” for rows, “Joke” for column, check the box to “Display clustered bar charts”. Select “Statistics” and check the box for “Chi-Square”. Select “Continue” and the select “OK”. The results above indicate that there is not a significant difference between how females and males answered the question “Would you participate in jokes that are derogatory to any racial group?” (p-value=0.397). Two-Sample T-Test and One-Way ANOVA The purpose of the two-sample t-test, also known as the independent samples t-test, is to determine if mean values of a particular continuous variable are significantly different for two groups. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is mathematically equivalent to the two-sample t-test, and is appropriate when there are two or more groups. There are 3 assumptions that must be met in order to perform these tests: Normality Homogeneity of variance for ANOVA Independence of groups and observations You can investigate normality with Q-Q plots or histograms and use Levene’s test to assess homogeneity of variance. You can also side-by-side box plots to investigate the relationship between a continuous dependent variable and a categorical predictor. In SPSS, select Analyze - Compare Means to find the two-sample t-test and one-way ANOVA For the side-by-side box plots, select Graphs- Legacy Dialogs - Boxplot, choose “Simple” and “Summaries for groups of cases”, and click “Define.” In the next dialog, move the continuous variable and the grouping variable from the left-hand list of variables to the “Variable” and “Category Axis” boxes. Try it: Use Section4_2_Data.sav. Is there a relationship between sex and the post intervention intension scale score? Sex is a categorical variable, the intension scale is continuous. We can use either an independent samples t-test or one-way ANOVA. Select Analyze - Compare Means - Independent Samples T Test. Select “BIndBehInt_Post” for Test Variable(s). Select “Sex” for Grouping Variable. Select “Define Groups…” and let group 1=1, group 2=2. Select “Continue” and “OK”. The tables above indicate that the males and females have similar average intension scale scores (males=5.3, females=5.59). We fail to reject the null hypothesis for Levene’s test, so we will report the information for “Equal variances assumed”. Our p-value is .631, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that males and females have similar average intention scale scores. Select Analyze - Compare Means - One-Way ANOVA“. Select”BIndBehInt_Post\" for the dependent list. Select “Sex” for the factor. Select “OK” The ANOVA table above yields the same p-value and conclusion as using the two-sample t-test. Select Graphs - Legacy Dialogs - Boxplot. Select “Simple” and “Summaries for groups of cases” and click “Define”. Select the continuous dependent variable for “Variable” and the grouping variable for “Category Axis”. Select “OK”. Paired T-Test A paired t-test, also known as a repeated measures t-test or dependent samples t-test, is appropriate when there are two related observations (variables) and we want to determine if the average values of these variables differ from one another. The purpose of the paired t-test is to test the same units of observation under different treatment conditions to see if a treatment effect exists. The test compares the pre-treatment value to the post-treatment value for each case. The null hypothesis is that the mean value of the differences for these two related variables is 0. If we reject this hypothesis, then we conclude that the difference is significantly different from 0. This test assumes that the sample mean of the differences is normally distributed. The test only considers cases with both pre-treatment and post-treatment values. In SPSS, select Analyze - Compare Means - Paired Samples T-Test. Try it: Use Section4_2_Data.sav. Investigate whether or not the average intention scores are statistically different from each other. Since these variables are pre and post variables, it would be interesting to see if the intervention was successful in increasing the scores of participants. To investigate this, we will use a paired t-test. Select Analyze - Compare Means - Paired Samples T-Test. Select “BIndBehInt_Pre” for Variable 1. Select “BIndBehInt_Post” for Variable 2. Select “OK”. The tables above indicate that there is a significant increase in average behavior intention score after the intervention (p-value&lt;.001). 5.10 Investigating Many Variables at a Time It is often useful to investigate the relationship between one outcome variable and multiple predictor variables. The type of the outcome variable determines the appropriate model; general linear models are appropriate for continuous outcomes and generalized linear models are appropriate for categorical outcomes. General linear models include simple linear regression and multiple linear regression while generalized linear models include binary logistic regression and ordinal logistic regression. Linear regression and binary linear regression will be covered through EXERCISES in this workshop, time permitting. 5.11 Repeated Measures, Longitudinal, Clustered, Multilevel, Mixed Procedures It is very common in many studies to take multiple measurements on a unit of analysis, typically a subject. These multiple measures may be occurring over time, conditions, regions, or the levels of any other variable. Depending on what the measurements are taking place over, there are many names we give these studies. It is also very common in many studies to have the units of analysis be clustered (i.e. grouped) into higher level clusters (i.e. groups). Sometimes the clusters themselves are further clustered into even higher level clusters, and so on. In all of these studies, we must use more advanced statistical procedures that take into consideration the possible correlation of observations that are coming from the same unit of analysis. While using advanced procedures to analyze such data sets is beyond the scope of this workshop, you should be able to identify these multilevel data sets and discuss them with your statistician. 5.12 Other Procedures in SPSS Here is a non-exhaustive list of other procedures in SPSS that you may use: Tests for checking the assumptions of normality Intraclass correlation coefficient Partial correlations General linear models Generalized linear models Categorical data analysis Randomized clinical trials Case-control clinical trials Matching and propensity scores Survival analysis Cox regression Two-stage least squares regression Probit regression Cluster analysis Discriminant analysis Factor analysis Principal components analysis Reliability analysis Path analysis Structural equations modeling Latent class analysis Multidimensional ccaling Spatial statistics Time series analysis Complex samples and survey methodology Missing data analysis and imputation Geographical information systems Qualitative data analysis Text mining Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis Functional data analysis Data mining Classification and regression trees (CART) Chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) Neural networks 5.13 Miscellaneous 5.13.1 Descriptive Statistics Analyze - Descriptive Statistics - Descriptives 5.13.2 Frequencies Analyze - Descriptive Statistics - Frequencies 5.13.3 Rank Cases Transform - Rank Cases 5.13.4 T-Tests &amp; One-Way ANOVA Analyze - Compare Means 5.13.5 Chi-Square Test Analyze - Descriptive Statistics - Crosstabs Check the Chi-square box under “Statistics” 5.13.6 Create a Code Book File - Display Data File Information - Working File Check output Can export or copy/paste into Word or Excel 5.13.7 Adjust Options Edit - Options You can select to display variable labels or variable names in dialog boxes You can change what Output looks like (labels, no labels) Many other options 5.13.8 Recall Recently Used Dialogs Button Will open recently used dialog boxes (chi-square cross tabs, frequencies, etc.) Button is fourth from the left at the top of the Data View screen 5.13.9 Jump to a Case Edit - Go to Case Can type in or select 5.13.10 Jump to a Variable Edit - Go to Variable Can select the variable from the drop down menu or start typing it 5.13.11 Spell Check In Variable View and Data View, upper right corner Will be grayed out in Data View if you do not have string variables 5.13.12 Sort Variable In Data View, right click the variable you would like to sort by Select “Sort Ascending” or “Sort Descending” 5.13.13 View Value Labels in Data View View - Check the box for Value Labels Check data in Data View 5.13.14 Weights in Crosstabs If you don’t have raw data (only cell counts) you can still do a chi-square crosstab in SPSS Open a blank SPSS data file The first variable will serve as the “weights” variable The next two variables represent rows and columns Data - Weight Cases Select “Weight Cases by” and use Var0001 for the data below Analyze - Descriptive Statistics - Crosstabs Enter in Var0002 for rows and Var0003 for columns for the data below EXAMPLE: Table of Counts Yes No Yes 35 90 No 50 100 SPSS Data Var0001 Var0002 Var0003 90.00 1.00 .0 50.00 .0 1.00 35.00 1.00 1.00 100.0 .0 .0 5.13.15 Useful websites Statnotes: http://faculty.chass.ncsu.edu/garson/PA765/statnote.htm https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/spss/ "],

The regression coefficient for A shows the effect of A when B=0. The regression coefficient for B shows the effect of B when A=0. The regression coefficient for A*B demonstrates how A changes with a one unit increase in B. It also demonstrates how B changes with a one unit increase in A. 6.1.2 Two Categorical Variables Let A represent gender 0=Female 1=Male Let B represent treatment condition 0=Control 1=Experimental The interaction regression coefficient shows whether the effect of treatment condition is different for males and females. The regression coefficient for A shows the difference in Y between males and females for the ‘control’ treatment group. The regression coefficient for B shows the difference in Y between treatment and control groups for females. 6.1.3 One Categorical and One Continuous Variable Let A represent gender 0=Female 1=Male Let B represent a continuous variable: age in years. The interaction regression coefficient shows if the effect of age on Y is different for males and females. The regression coefficient for A shows the difference between males and females when age is equal to zero. The regression coefficient for B shows the effect of age for females. 6.1.4 Two Continuous Variables Let A represent a continuous variable: IQ score. Let B represent a continuous variable: Age. The interaction regression coefficient shows if the relationship between age and Y differs according to IQ if the relationship between IQ and Y differs according to age. The regression coefficient for A shows the relationship between IQ and Y when age equals zero. The regression coefficient for B shows the relationship between age and Y when IQ equals zero. 6.2 Three-Way Interactions The same principles apply from above. The general model: Y=A+B+C+A*B+A*C+B*C+A*B*C The coefficient for A shows the effect of A on Y when both B and C are zero. The coefficient for B shows the effect of B on Y when both A and C are zero. The coefficient for C shows the effect of C on Y when both A and B are zero. The coefficient for A*B shows the interaction between A and B when C is zero. The coefficient for A*C shows the interaction between A and C when B is zero. The coefficient for B*C shows the interaction between B and C when A is zero. The interaction regression coefficient shows if the relationship between A and Y differs according to B and C B and Y differs according to A and C C and Y differs according to A and B. "]
