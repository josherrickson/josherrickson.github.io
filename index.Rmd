I am a statistical consultant at [CSCAR](http://cscar.research.umich.edu/) and adjunct faculty in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan.

I contribute to the development of the *optmatch*[[Github](https://github.com/markmfredrickson/optmatch), [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/optmatch/index.html)] package for Optimal Matching.

**[Misc. Code & Software](code.html)**: Bits and bobs that are probably useful to almost nobody, about topics like Linux or Emacs.
