> The **rule of three** states that if a certain event did not occur in a sample
with `n` subjects, the interval from `0` to `3/n` is a 95% confidence interval
for the rate of occurrences in the population. When `n` is greater than 30, this
is a good approximation of results from more sensitive tests.
