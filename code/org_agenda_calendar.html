    <h1>Org-Agenda as a Calendar</h1>

    <p>I’ve been looking for an offline calendaring solution that will allow
      smooth syncing via Dropbox or an alternative. I originally
      tried <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird/">Sunbird</a>
      but there was always issues with duplicate events. I’ve been wanting a
      plain-text variant to avoid these issues, but the existing solutions are
      not ideal.
    </p>

    <p>
      Simultaneously, I’ve been looking for an excuse to
      learn <a href="http://orgmode.org">org-mode</a> for a while. It is always
      hyped as a terrific solution to any outlining scenario (which, truly,
      calendaring is), but has a steep learning curve for anything past a very
      basic outline.
    </p>

    <p>
      After spending months periodically searching online for a good tutorial on
      using org-mode as a calendar, I found no complete tutorial, but I began to
      accumulate enough bits and pieces to figure out the setup. The below is
      both for my benefit, to document how my system works in the event of
      data-loss or memory-loss, and to attempt a unified tutorial on org-mode
      calendaring.
    </p>

    <p>
      This setup was accomplished on Emacs 24.3.50.1 (though I suspect earlier
      24.x versions will suffice) with org-mode 8.0.3 (again, I suspect earlier
      8.x versions will work).
    </p>

    <h3 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h3>

    <p>
      First, decide where you are going to keep your files. I’d suggest their
      own directly, maybe <code>~/.emacs.d/org</code>. Create the
      directory. <code>touch</code> a file in there
      named <code>whatever.org</code>. You’ll probably want multiple files for
      each type of calender (to avoid any one getting overwhelmingly large) but
      you can create the rest later.
    </p>

    <p>
      Orgmode’s categories are analogous to individual calendars in Google
      Calender or iCal. You can put each event into a category, and then do
      things such as color them by category, or show only certain categories.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two ways to organize your categories. First, just have one per
      file. I prefer this option as it keeps from having too long of a file, and
      I find it easier to think of each category as completely independent. The
      second way would be to use a single file, and have each category in its
      own subgroup.
    </p>

    <h3>Begin creating some events</h3>

    <p>
      As I’ve said, at its core, orgmode is an outlining system, so org-mode
      files tend to (generally) follow this syntax:
    </p>

    <pre><code>* First level
** Second level
*** Third level
** back to second
* New first level
** Second level under second top</code></pre>

    <p>
      So the single <code>*</code> is the top-most level, <code>**</code> is
      nested below it, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Calendar events will follow the same structure. Generally, you’ll have the
      top level by a category, and then all events under that category will be
      in the second level, but you could add more structure to it by nesting a
      sub-category with its own events.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here’s some very simple events.
    </p>

    <pre><code>* Work
** Meeting with Bob
&lt;2013-06-12 Wed 13:00-14:00&gt;
** Call with Sally
&lt;2013-06-14 Fri 3:30pm&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>
      The time stamp should be fairly self-explanatory. The day of the week and
      time are both completely optional. For time, note that two times separated
      by a <code>-</code> are the duration of the event, while a single time is
      simply a start-time (a reminder perhaps). You can enter military time or
      am/pm. (Note, for future snippets, I will often ignore the <code>*</code>
      level, just assume they’re in a larger file under a top level.)
    </p>

    <p>
      To make an event spanning multiple days (or a longer alternative to the
      duration above), use this.
    </p>

    <pre><code>** Trip to LA
&lt;2013-07-10&gt;--&lt;2013-07-15&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>
      Finally, for a recurring event, you can do this.
    </p>

    <pre><code>** Team Meeting
&lt;2013-05-10 Fri 10:00-11:00am +1w&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <code>+1w</code> implies that this event will repeat every week at the
      same time &amp; date, ad infinitum. The number can be changed, and the
      usual codes can replace <code>w</code> (e.g. <code>d</code> for days, etc)
      (See below for more advanced repeating events.)
    </p>

    <h3>Viewing your agenda</h3>

    <p>
      Now, some editing of your config file (<code>.emacs</code>
      or <code>init.el</code>, either in <code>~</code> or
      <code>~/.emacs.d/</code>). First, you’ll need to add
    </p>

    <pre><code>&lt;setq org-agenda-files &#39;(&quot;~/.emacs.d/org&quot;)&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>
      Of course, change that directory as needed. All <code>.org</code> files
      living there will be used for the calendar, assuming an event has a
      time-stamp.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, call <code>M-x org-agenda</code> to view your calendar. (Note: You
      can use <code>C-h f org-agenda</code> to see the default key-bindings, and
      you can use a line like <code>(global-set-key (kbd "C-c a")
      'org-agenda)</code> to modify it.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Hopefully, you now see your weekly schedule! You can visit
      the <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-commands.html">Org
      manual</a> for a full list of key bindings, but the most useful ones are
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>f</code> and <code>b</code>: Go forward or backwards in time.
      </li>

      <li>
        <code>v</code> followed by <code>m</code>, <code>y</code>
        or <code>w</code>: View a month, a year, or a week at a time
        respectively.
      </li>

      <li>
        <code>.</code>: Return to today.
      </li>

      <li>
        <code>Enter</code>: While your cursor is on an event, open that event in
        its original file.
      </li>

      <li>
        <code>f</code> and <code>b</code>: Go forward or backwards in time.
      </li>

      <li>
        <code>r</code>: Rebuild the agenda (if you’ve been editing files).
      </li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Categories</h3>

    <p>
      By default, the file-name of your <code>.org</code> file are your
      file-name, so if you named your file <code>calendar.org</code>, you might
      be seeing
    </p>

    <pre><code>Wednesday  12 June 2013
calendar:    1:00pm- 2:00pm Meeting with Bob</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <code>calendar:</code> tag can be made more informative by use
      PROPERTIES. For example, taking the sample from above,
    </p>

    <pre><code>* Work
:CATEGORY: Work
** Meeting with Bob
&lt;2013-06-12 Wed 13:00-14:00&gt;
** Call with Sally
&lt;2013-06-14 Fri 3:30pm&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>
      Now, the calender would look like
    </p>

    <pre><code>Wednesday  12 June 2013
Work:        1:00pm- 2:00pm Meeting with Bob</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <code>:CATEGORY</code> will apply to a given event and all below it.
      So if you have your work file, you can add a second level, for
      example <code>** Off-site Events</code>, give it a category
      like <code>:CATEGORY: Off-site</code> and then put events below it,
      <code>*** An off-site visit</code>, then even if this is nested in the
      Work file, it will have the <code>Off-site:</code> category.
    </p>

    <h3>Useful config settings</h3>

    <p>
      Here’s some settings I find useful. These go in your config file as above.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        A week starts on Sunday as opposed to Monday:

        <pre><code>&lt;setq org-agenda-start-on-weekday 0&gt;</code></pre>

      </li>

      <li>
        Use 12-hour clock instead of 24-hour in agenda view:

        <pre><code>&lt;setq org-agenda-timegrid-use-ampm 1&gt;</code></pre>
      </li>

      <li>
        By default, the time-grid is only shown today if you have any events,
        this makes it always show today regardless of events.

        <pre><code>&lt;setq org-agenda-time-grid &#39;((daily today today)
#(&quot;----------------&quot; 0 16 (org-heading t))
(800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000)))&gt;</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Some advanced features</h3>

    <h4>Color-coding</h4>

    <p>
      The following fairly self-explanatory code in your config file will color
      events. You can
      use <a href="http://raebear.net/comp/emacscolors.html">this page</a> to
      get a list of colors. Simply modify the list of <code>(color-org-header
      "tag" "color")</code> to your needs.
    </p>

    <pre><code>(add-hook &#39;org-finalize-agenda-hook
          (lambda ()
             (save-excursion
               (color-org-header &quot;Personal:&quot;  &quot;green&quot;)
               (color-org-header &quot;Birthdays:&quot; &quot;gold&quot;)
               (color-org-header &quot;Work:&quot;      &quot;orange&quot;)
               (color-org-header &quot;Off-site:&quot;  &quot;SkyBlue4&quot;))))

(defun color-org-header (tag col)
  &quot;&quot;
  (interactive)
  (goto-char (point-min))
  (while (re-search-forward tag nil t)
    (add-text-properties (match-beginning 0) (point-at-eol)
    `(face (:foreground ,col)))))</code></pre>

    <h4>Complicated scheduling</h4>

    <p>
      You can use diary sexp entries to do more complicated scheduling. There
      are plenty of places online to see details, for
      example <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#Appointments/Diary">here</a>,
      but here’s an example to get you started.
    </p>

    <pre><code>** 10:00-11:30am Twice weekly!
&lt;%%(org-class 2013 9 3 2013 12 11 1)&gt;
&lt;%%(org-class 2013 9 3 2013 12 11 3)&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>
      This says this event is scheduled from 9/3/2013 to 12/11/2013, on every
      Monday (the final 1 in the first time-stamp) and Wednesday (the final 3 in
      the second time-stamp). Note that the time is in the <code>**</code> line!
    </p>

    <h4>Birthdays and Holidays</h4>

    <p>
      Without further comment, here’s a neat way to have holidays and birthdays
      in your agenda.
    </p>

    <pre><code>* Birthday
#+CATEGORY: Holidays
%%(org-calendar-holiday)
#+CATEGORY: Birthdays
%%(diary-anniversary  9 12 1957) John, %d y.o.
%%(diary-anniversary  4  3 1962) Sally, %d y.o.</code></pre>
