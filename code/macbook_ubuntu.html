    <h2>Useful Commands for Running Ubuntu on a Macbook</h2>
    <p>
      Note: These are based on Ubuntu 12.04 on a Macbook 7,1.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To control the keyboard backlight, use
        <pre> echo 0 | sudo tee -a /sys/class/leds/smc::kbd_backlight/brightness </pre>
          0 turns it off, 255 is fullest brightness.
      </li>
      <li>By default, the headphone jack has a bright red LED shining in it. This turns it off.
        <pre> amixer set IEC958 off</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Some commands to make the trackpad perform like it does in OS X. The first disables tap-to-click completely, the second allows
        horizontal scrolling, and the last supposedly tries to stop accidental palm presses (though its not foolproof).
        <pre>
          synclient MaxTapTime=0
          synclient HorizTwoFingerScroll=1
          synclient PalmDetect=1</pre>
      </li>
      <li>If the Macbook won't goto sleep automatically when the lid is closed, you can run the following before closing it.
        <pre> sudo /etc/acpi/sleep.sh</pre>
        Alternatively, install package <code>uswsusp</code>, and run the following.
        <pre> sudo s2ram --force</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
