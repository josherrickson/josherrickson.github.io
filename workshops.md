## Notes for workshops I have given

[Matching with R](https://errickson.net/matching-slides/index.html): Using the [`optmatch`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/optmatch/index.html) package in R to perform matching, with or without propensity scores.

[Introduction to Stata](https://errickson.net/stata1/index.html): An introductory set of notes focused on data management targeted at individuals who have never used Stata before.


[Regression Modeling with Stata](https://errickson.net/stata-regression/index.html): Fitting regression models (linear, logistic, Poisson, etc) in Stata.

[Mixed Effect Modeling with Stata](https://errickson.net/stata-mixed/index.html): Fitting mixed effects regression models (linear, logistic, Poisson, etc) in Stata.

### Outdated

[Intermediate Stata (Statistical Modeling)](https://errickson.net/stata2/index.html): Statistical modeling including basic tests, graphing and modeling, in Stata. The modeling sections have been mostly replaced by the individual workshops in regression and mixed effects above.

[New Data Management Features in Stata 16](https://errickson.net/stata-16/index.html): Introducing `frames`, storing multiple data sets in memory; and `vl`, defining variable lists. These notes have been integrated into the Introduction to Stata notes.
